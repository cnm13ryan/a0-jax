### FunctionDef __init__(self, N, get_all_roots_freq)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) data structure.
**parameters**: This Function takes two parameters:
· parameter1: N - An integer representing the number of elements in the DSU structure.
· parameter2: get_all_roots_freq (optional) - A function that returns a dictionary mapping each root element to its frequency. If provided, this function is used during the initialization process.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method initializes the DSU data structure with the specified number of elements `N`. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Super Initialization**: 
   ```python
   super().__init__()
   ```
   This line calls the constructor of the parent class (likely another DSU implementation or a base class) to ensure that any necessary initialization steps are performed.

2. **Parent Array Setup**:
   ```python
   self.parent = jnp.arange(0, N, 1, dtype=jnp.int32)
   ```
   This line initializes the `parent` array using JAX's `jnp.arange`, setting up an initial state where each element is its own parent. The `dtype=jnp.int32` ensures that all indices are stored as 32-bit integers.

3. **Size Array Setup**:
   ```python
   self.size = jnp.ones((N,), dtype=jnp.int32)
   ```
   This sets up the `size` array to keep track of the size of each set. Initially, every element is its own set with a size of 1.

4. **Store N**:
   ```python
   self.N = N
   ```
   The number of elements `N` is stored as an attribute for future reference.

5. **Optional Frequency Function Setup**:
   ```python
   self.get_all_roots_freq = get_all_roots_freq
   ```
   If the `get_all_roots_freq` function is provided, it is stored as an instance variable to be used later in operations that require root frequency information.

**Note**: Ensure that JAX's `jnp` module (or a similar library) is imported and available for use. The optional parameter `get_all_roots_freq` can be customized based on specific requirements but must return the correct data type if provided.
***
### FunctionDef masked_reset(self, mask)
**masked_reset**: The function of masked_reset is to reset sets in the specified mask.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: mask (jnp.ndarray): A boolean array where `True` indicates the positions where the corresponding set should be reset.

**Code Description**: 
The `masked_reset` method is designed to selectively update parent and size arrays based on a given mask. It operates by creating temporary variables for the original parent and size arrays, which are used to perform operations without modifying the current state until the final assignment.

1. **Initialization of Temporary Variables**:
   ```python
   parent = jnp.arange(0, self.N, 1, dtype=jnp.int32)
   size = jnp.ones((self.N,), dtype=jnp.int32)
   ```
   Here, `parent` is initialized to an array where each element represents its own set initially. The `size` array is initialized with ones, indicating that all sets start as singletons.

2. **Update Parent Array**:
   ```python
   self.parent = jnp.where(mask, parent, self.parent)
   ```
   This line uses a conditional operation to update the `parent` attribute of the DSU object. For positions where `mask` is `True`, it sets the corresponding elements in `self.parent` to the values from `parent`. Otherwise, it retains the current value of `self.parent`.

3. **Update Size Array**:
   ```python
   self.size = jnp.where(mask, size, self.size)
   ```
   Similarly, this line updates the `size` attribute based on the mask. For positions where `mask` is `True`, it sets the corresponding elements in `self.size` to ones (indicating singletons). Otherwise, it retains the current values of `self.size`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input `mask` is a boolean array of the same length as the number of sets (`N`). Any mismatch will lead to incorrect behavior.
- This method allows for efficient and selective updates in disjoint set union structures, which can be useful in various algorithms requiring dynamic management of connected components.
***
### FunctionDef find_set_pure(self, element)
**find_set_pure**: The function of find_set_pure is to find the root of an element's set without updating the parent array.
• parameter1: element (int) - The element whose set needs to be found.

**Code Description**: 
The `find_set_pure` method implements a pure version of finding the root in a disjoint-set data structure. It avoids updating the parent pointers, which can be beneficial when the `get_all_roots` method is called frequently and better performance on GPU is desired. The function uses either a simple loop or a JAX `while_loop` depending on whether the frequency of calling the `get_all_roots` method has been set.

1. **If get_all_roots_freq is not None**:
   - A loop runs for `self.get_all_roots_freq + 1` iterations, updating the `element` to its parent in each iteration.
   - This process continues until the element points to itself (i.e., it reaches the root).

2. **If get_all_roots_freq is None**:
   - The function uses JAX's `while_loop`, which requires defining a condition (`cond`) and a body function (`loop`).
   - The condition checks if the current parent of the element is not equal to the element itself.
   - The loop updates the element to its parent in each iteration, effectively traversing up the set until reaching the root.

This method ensures that the parent pointers are not updated during the search process, which can be useful for maintaining the integrity of other operations like `get_all_roots`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `self.get_all_roots_freq` is appropriately set before calling this function to optimize performance.
- The use of JAX's `while_loop` might require the input data to be in a format compatible with JAX.

**Output Example**: If called with an element 5 and it belongs to a set rooted at 3, the method will return 3. For example:
```python
result = find_set_pure(5)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```
#### FunctionDef cond(u)
**cond**: The function of cond is to check if a node `u` belongs to its own set.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: u - An integer representing the index of the node.

**Code Description**: 
The function `cond(u)` checks whether the parent of node `u` is not equal to `u` itself. This indicates that node `u` is not the representative (or root) of its own set. In a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure, each set has a unique representative element which serves as the root of the set. If the parent of a node `u` is different from `u`, it means that `u` does not belong to its own set and must be connected to another set.

In the context of DSU (Disjoint Set Union), this function is often used during path compression in the find operation, where nodes are checked for their root status. If a node's parent is different from itself, it implies that further checks or operations need to be performed on the node to ensure correct set membership and structure.

**Note**: 
- Ensure `u` is a valid index within the DSU data structure.
- The function assumes that the internal state of the DSU object (`self`) has been properly initialized with parent pointers.
- This function is typically used in conjunction with other methods like `find_set_pure`, which may perform path compression to flatten the structure and optimize future queries.

**Output Example**: 
If `u` is a node index, and its parent is not `u`, then `cond(u)` returns `True`. For example:
```python
# Assuming self.parent[3] = 2 (indicating that node 3's parent is node 2)
print(cond(3))  # Output: True

# Assuming self.parent[2] = 2 (indicating that node 2 is its own root)
print(cond(2))  # Output: False
```
***
#### FunctionDef loop(u)
**loop**: The function of loop is to return the parent of the given node u.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: u - An integer representing the node index.

**Code Description**: This method `loop` serves as a helper function within the `find_set_pure` method, which is part of the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) class. The purpose of this function is to recursively find and return the parent node of the given node `u`. Since it's marked with ✳️loop, we can infer that there might be a loop or iterative process involved in finding the root or parent node.

The implementation simply returns `self.parent[u]`, which implies that the DSU class maintains an attribute called `parent` that stores the parent of each node. This is typically used to implement path compression and union-find operations efficiently. The function assumes that `u` is a valid index within the bounds of the `parent` array.

**Note**: 
- Ensure `u` is a valid index before calling this method to avoid out-of-bound errors.
- This function should be called as part of the broader `find_set_pure` logic, which likely involves path compression for optimization.

**Output Example**: If the `self.parent` list is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, and `u = 2`, then `loop(2)` would return `2`. This indicates that node 2 points to itself as its parent in this simplified example.
***
***
### FunctionDef find_set(self, v)
**find_set**: The function of find_set is to find the root of a set and update the parent array.
· parameter1: v (int) - The element whose set needs to be found.

**Code Description**: This method implements the process of finding the root of an element in a disjoint-set data structure, ensuring that the parent pointers are updated during the search. It leverages JAX's `while_loop` for efficient execution when the frequency of calling the `get_all_roots` method is set to None.

The function first checks if `self.get_all_roots_freq` is not None. If it is not None, a simple loop runs for `self.get_all_roots_freq + 1` iterations, updating the parent array by setting each element to its parent until the root is reached. This approach optimizes performance on GPU when the frequency of calling the `get_all_roots` method is high.

If `self.get_all_roots_freq` is None, JAX's `while_loop` is used for a more dynamic and potentially faster traversal. The loop defines two functions: `cond`, which checks if the current parent of the element is not equal to the element itself; and `loop`, which updates the element to its parent in each iteration.

The function returns the root after updating the parent array, ensuring that all elements are connected directly to their respective roots.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.get_all_roots_freq` is appropriately set before calling this function to optimize performance. The use of JAX's `while_loop` might require the input data to be in a format compatible with JAX.

**Output Example**: If called with an element 5 and it belongs to a set rooted at 3, the method will return 3. For example:
```python
result = find_set(5)
print(result)  # Output: 3
```
#### FunctionDef cond(pu)
**cond**: The function of cond is to determine if a node has not yet been assigned its own parent.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: pu (a tuple containing two elements, where the second element is the node `u`)

**Code Description**: 
The function `cond` checks whether the current parent of node `u` is not equal to `u` itself. This condition is used within the context of a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure, typically in algorithms that manage connected components or sets of elements.

In detail:
1. The function accepts one parameter, `pu`, which is expected to be a tuple where the second element (`pu[1]`) represents the node `u`.
2. Inside the function, it unpacks this tuple into two variables: `_` (which is typically ignored) and `u` (representing the node in question).
3. It then checks if the parent of node `u`, stored in `self.parent[u]`, is different from `u`. If they are not equal, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This function is crucial for identifying nodes that have yet to be assigned their own parent during operations such as union-find algorithms. It helps in determining when a node can be considered the root of its set.

**Note**: Ensure that the tuple passed to `cond` always contains exactly two elements and that the second element is valid (exists within the range of indices for `self.parent`). Failure to meet these requirements will result in undefined behavior or errors.

**Output Example**: 
If `self.parent[u] != u`, then `cond(pu)` returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

For example:
- If `self.parent[3] = 4` and `pu = (None, 3)`, then `cond(pu)` will return `True`.
- If `self.parent[5] = 5` and `pu = (None, 5)`, then `cond(pu)` will return `False`.
***
#### FunctionDef loop(pu)
**loop**: The function of loop is to update the parent set and return the updated parent pointer.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: pu - This is a tuple containing two elements: p (the current parent set) and u (the element whose parent needs to be updated).

**Code Description**: 
The `loop` method takes a single argument, `pu`, which is expected to be a tuple. The function unpacks this tuple into two variables, `p` and `u`. It then updates the parent set `p` for the element `u` by calling the `at[u].set(root)` method on `p`. This method presumably sets the root of the subset containing `u` to `root`. Finally, it returns a new tuple consisting of the updated parent set `p` and the current value of `self.parent[u]`.

**Note**: Ensure that `pu` is always provided as a valid tuple with two elements. Also, verify that `at`, `set`, `root`, and `parent` are correctly defined and accessible within the context where this method is called.

**Output Example**: 
If `pu = (p, u)` where `p` is an instance of a parent set structure and `u` is an element in that set, after calling `loop(pu)`, it might return something like `(new_p, self.parent[u])`. Here, `new_p` would be the updated parent set with the root for `u` set to `root`, and `self.parent[u]` would remain unchanged or reflect its current state.

***
### FunctionDef get_all_roots(self)
**get_all_roots**: The function of get_all_roots is to find the root of each element in the DSU (Disjoint Set Union) structure and update the parent array accordingly.
**parameters**:
· self: An instance of the class, which contains the necessary attributes such as `N` and `parent`.
**Code Description**: 
The function `get_all_roots` performs a series of operations to find the root for each element in the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) structure. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by creating an array `v` using JAX's `arange` function, which initializes an array with integers from 0 to `self.N-1`. This array represents all elements in the DSU.

2. **Mapping Function**: A lambda function is defined that takes a single element `s` and an index `v`, then calls the `find_set_pure` method on `s` with `v` as its argument. The `find_set_pure` method likely returns the root of the set containing the element `v`.

3. **Vectorization**: Using JAX's `vmap` function, the lambda function is applied to each element in the array `v`. This vectorized operation ensures that the `find_set_pure` method is called for every single element.

4. **Update Parent Array**: The result of the mapped operations is stored in the variable `roots`, and then assigned back to `self.parent`. This step updates the parent array, making future calls faster by precomputing the root for each element.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the `roots` array, which contains the roots of all elements.

**Note**: Ensure that the `find_set_pure` method is implemented correctly to avoid incorrect results. Also, make sure that JAX and other necessary libraries are imported at the beginning of the file.

**Output Example**: 
Assuming `self.N = 5`, a possible return value could be `[0, 2, 4, 1, 3]`. This means that the roots of elements 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 0, 2, 4, 1, and 3 respectively.
***
### FunctionDef union_sets(self, a, b)
**union_sets**: The function of union_sets is to merge two sets containing elements `a` and `b`.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: a (int) - An element belonging to one set.
· parameter2: b (int) - An element belonging to another set.

**Code Description**: 
The `union_sets` method performs the union operation on two disjoint sets, merging them into a single set. Here is a detailed analysis of each step in the code:

1. **Initial Setup and Finding Roots**:
   - The function first calls `find_set_pure(a)` to find the root of the set containing element `a`. This ensures that any cycles or loops are avoided during the traversal, as no parent pointers are updated.
   - Similarly, it finds the root of the set containing element `b` using `find_set_pure(b)`.

2. **Root Comparison and Union Operation**:
   - The roots obtained from the previous steps are stored in variables `root_a` and `root_b`.
   - If `root_a` is not equal to `root_b`, it means that the sets containing elements `a` and `b` were previously disjoint.
   - To merge these two sets, one of the roots (say `root_a`) becomes the parent of the other root (`root_b`). This step ensures that all elements in both sets are now connected under a single root.

3. **Updating Parent Pointers**:
   - After determining the new parent-child relationship, the function updates the parent pointers to reflect this change.
   - Specifically, it sets `self.parent[root_b]` to be equal to `root_a`. This step effectively merges the two sets by making all elements of one set point to a common root.

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - The method ensures that no unnecessary updates are made to parent pointers during the merge operation, which can be beneficial for performance optimization in scenarios where frequent calls to `find_set_pure` might occur.
   - By avoiding updates, this function supports better performance on GPU architectures or when dealing with large datasets.

5. **Integration with Other Methods**:
   - The use of `find_set_pure` within `union_sets` ensures that the disjoint-set data structure remains consistent and efficient for operations like union-find.
   - This method is typically part of a larger set of functions used in algorithms such as Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning trees or in various graph-related problems.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `find_set_pure` function has been called with appropriate parameters before invoking `union_sets`.
- The choice to avoid updating parent pointers during the union operation can impact the overall structure of the disjoint-set forest, so this decision should be made based on specific use cases and performance requirements.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming elements 1 and 2 belong to different sets initially.
result = union_sets(1, 2)
print(result)  # No output as the function does not return a value directly but modifies the internal state.
```

In this example, after calling `union_sets`, the sets containing elements 1 and 2 are merged into one set. The exact root of the new combined set is determined by the internal logic of the disjoint-set data structure.
#### FunctionDef if_true(x, y, parent, size)
**if_true**: The function of `if_true` is to determine whether a condition is true and perform actions based on that determination.
**parameters**:
· x: An element or value to be checked against the condition.
· y: Another element or value to be compared with `x`.
· parent: A reference to the parent structure, likely representing a tree or forest of nodes.
· size: A collection indicating the sizes of different components in the data structure.

**Code Description**: The function `if_true` is designed to handle union operations within a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure. It evaluates whether a condition involving two elements (`x` and `y`) is true, and based on this evaluation, it adjusts the parent pointers and sizes of the components involved.

1. **Condition Evaluation**: The function first uses the `select_tree` method to determine if the size of component `x` is less than the size of component `y`. This condition helps in deciding which element will be the root or which component will be merged into another.
2. **Tree Selection**: If the condition is true, it swaps the values of `x` and `y` using tuple unpacking. This ensures that the smaller (or equal) sized tree becomes a child of the larger one, maintaining the structure's efficiency.
3. **Parent Update**: The parent pointer for component `y` is updated to point to `x`, effectively making `x` the new root or parent of `y`.
4. **Size Adjustment**: The size of component `x` is increased by adding the size of component `y`. This update reflects the merging of two components into a single, larger one.

This function plays a crucial role in maintaining the efficiency and correctness of the DSU data structure during union operations.

**Note**: Ensure that the input parameters are correctly formatted to avoid errors. The `parent` object should be mutable or accessible for updates, and the `size` collection should support element-wise addition.

**Output Example**: 
Given inputs:
- x = 1
- y = 2
- parent (a reference to a mutable structure)
- size (a collection of integers)

If the condition `x < y` is true, the function will return updated `parent` and `size` values such as:
```python
parent: {2: 1}
size: [3, ...]
```
Where `parent[2] = 1` indicates that node 2 is now a child of node 1, and `size[1] += size[2]` reflects the updated size of the component rooted at node 1.
***
***
### FunctionDef pp(self)
**pp**: The function of pp is to print the parent array and size array of the Disjoint Set Union (DSU) data structure.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
· parameter1: None

**Code Description**: 
The `pp` method in the DSU class is designed to provide a human-readable representation of the internal state of the disjoint set union. It prints two important arrays:
- **Parent Array (`self.parent`)**: This array stores the parent node for each element, which helps in determining the root or leader of a particular subset.
- **Size Array (`self.size`)**: This array keeps track of the size (or number of elements) in each subset. It is used to optimize the union operation by always attaching the smaller tree under the larger one.

Here’s a detailed analysis:
1. The method begins with `print("Parent:", self.parent, "Size:", self.size)`. 
2. This line prints two pieces of information: the current state of the parent array and the size array.
3. The `self` parameter is implicitly passed by Python and refers to the instance of the DSU class on which this method is called.

**Note**: When using the `pp` function, ensure that you have initialized a DSU object with appropriate data before calling it. This will allow you to inspect the current state of the disjoint set union structure easily.
