## ClassDef TicTacToeWinnerChecker
**TicTacToeWinnerChecker**: The function of TicTacToeWinnerChecker is to determine if there is a winner in a Tic Tac Toe game by scanning the board for winning patterns.
**attributes**: The attributes of this Class are as follows:
· `conv`: A Conv2D layer used for pattern recognition on the board.

**Code Description**: 
The `TicTacToeWinnerChecker` class is designed to identify if there is a winner in a Tic Tac Toe game by scanning the game board. It uses a convolutional neural network (Conv2D) with specific filters to detect winning patterns on the board. The constructor initializes this Conv2D layer and sets up its weights for recognizing horizontal, vertical, and diagonal winning lines.

The `__init__` method performs the following steps:
1. Initializes the base class using `super().__init__()`.
2. Creates a Conv2D layer with 8 filters of size 3x3.
3. Defines the filter weights to recognize different winning patterns (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
4. Replaces the original weight matrix of the Conv2D layer with these custom weights.

The `__call__` method takes a board state as input and performs the following operations:
1. Reshapes the board into a 4-dimensional tensor suitable for the Conv2D layer.
2. Passes this reshaped board through the Conv2D layer to generate outputs.
3. Identifies the maximum absolute value from these outputs, which corresponds to the strongest winning pattern detected.
4. Based on the identified maximum value, it determines if there is a clear winner (value 3) or returns 0 otherwise.

This class is called by `TicTacToeGame` during each move to check for a winner after updating the board state. The `TicTacToeGame` instance creates an instance of `TicTacToeWinnerChecker` in its constructor and uses it to determine if the game has ended with a win or not.

**Note**: Ensure that the input board is properly formatted as a 1D array before calling the `__call__` method. The class assumes that the board state is represented by an integer array where each element corresponds to a cell on the board (0 for empty, 1 for player X, and -1 for player O).

**Output Example**: If the input board represents a winning configuration for player X, the `__call__` method might return `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, indicating that there is a clear winner (player X) in one of the detected patterns. If no such pattern exists, it returns an array of zeros.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the TicTacToeWinnerChecker by setting up a convolutional layer with specific weights.
**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters other than `self`.
**Code Description**: 
The provided code initializes an instance of the `TicTacToeWinnerChecker` class. It performs several steps:
1. **Inheritance Initialization**: The `__init__` method first calls the `__init__` method of its superclass using `super().__init__()`. This ensures that any initialization logic defined in the parent class is executed.
2. **Convolutional Layer Setup**: A convolutional layer (`conv`) is created with the following specifications:
    - Number of input channels: 1
    - Number of output channels (filters): 8
    - Filter size: 3x3
    - Padding type: "VALID"
3. **Weight Initialization**: The weights for this convolutional layer are initialized using a NumPy array (`weight`). This array is then assigned to the `conv` object's weight attribute.
4. **Weight Values Assignment**:
   - A single filter (first channel) is set with a value of 1 in its first row, representing horizontal lines.
   - Another filter (second channel) is set with a value of 1 in its first column, representing vertical lines.
   - Diagonal filters are set with values of 1 along the main and anti-diagonal axes, using indices to specify positions.
5. **Shape Assertion**: An assertion checks that the shape of the `weight` array matches the expected shape of the convolutional layer's weight tensor.
6. **Layer Replacement**: The `conv` object is updated by replacing its weight attribute with the newly initialized `weight` array.

**Note**: Ensure that you have the necessary libraries (`pax`, `numpy`) imported before using this code snippet, as these are not included in the provided context. Additionally, verify that the `replace` method exists and behaves as expected for the `conv` object to avoid runtime errors.

### FunctionDef __call__(self, board)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to determine the winner in a Tic Tac Toe game based on the given board state.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: board - A 4D numpy array representing the current state of the Tic TacToe board.

**Code Description**: 
The `__call__` method processes the input board and determines if there is a winning condition. Here's a detailed analysis:

- **Step 1: Reshape and Convert Data Type**
    ```python
    board = board[None, :, :, None].astype(jnp.float32)
    ```
    This line reshapes the input `board` to have an additional dimension (making it a 4D array) and converts its data type to float32. The use of `[None]` at the beginning adds a new axis, which is necessary for certain operations that require a specific tensor shape.

- **Step 2: Apply Convolution**
    ```python
    x = self.conv(board)
    ```
    This line applies a convolution operation using the `conv` method (likely defined elsewhere in the class) to the reshaped board. The purpose of this step is to extract features from the board that are relevant for determining the winner.

- **Step 3: Calculate Maximum Absolute Value**
    ```python
    m = jnp.max(jnp.abs(x))
    ```
    This line calculates the maximum absolute value across all elements in the tensor `x`. The use of `jnp.abs` ensures that both positive and negative values are considered, which might be relevant for distinguishing between player marks (e.g., +1 for one player, -1 for another).

- **Step 4: Determine Winner Indicator**
    ```python
    m1 = jnp.where(m == jnp.max(x), 1, -1)
    ```
    This line creates a binary indicator based on the maximum value calculated in Step 3. If `m` equals the maximum absolute value of `x`, it assigns 1 (indicating a potential winning condition). Otherwise, it assigns -1.

- **Step 5: Return Winner Condition**
    ```python
    return jnp.where(m == 3, m1, 0)
    ```
    This final line returns a binary indicator for the winner. If `m` equals 3 (which is likely a predefined winning condition value), it returns `m1`. Otherwise, it returns 0, indicating no winner.

**Note**: 
- The method assumes that the convolution operation (`self.conv`) and the use of JAX library (`jnp.max`, `jnp.where`) are correctly implemented elsewhere in the class.
- The constant value 3 used as a condition for determining the winner should be defined or documented somewhere within the class.

**Output Example**: 
If the board configuration indicates a win by one player, the method might return an array like `[1, -1, 0, ..., 0]` (indicating that the first and second elements are winning conditions). If there is no winner, it will return all zeros.

## Syntax

```python
def calculateDiscount(originalPrice: float, discountRate: float) -> float:
    pass
```

## Parameters

- **originalPrice** (float): The original price of the item before applying any discounts.
- **discountRate** (float): The percentage discount to be applied. For example, a 15% discount would be represented as `0.15`.

## Return Value

- **float**: The calculated discount amount.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Usage

```python
discount = calculateDiscount(100.0, 0.1)
print(discount)  # Output: 10.0

```python
totalDiscount = calculateDiscount(150.0, 0.2) + calculateDiscount(150.0, 0.1)
print(totalDiscount)  # Output: 37.5
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the `originalPrice` and `discountRate` are non-negative values.
- The function returns a precise float value representing the discount amount.

## Implementation Details

The `calculateDiscount` function operates by multiplying the `originalPrice` with the `discountRate`. This product yields the discount amount, which is then returned as the output.

```python
def calculateDiscount(originalPrice: float, discountRate: float) -> float:
    return originalPrice * discountRate
```

## Example Use Case

Suppose an item originally priced at $200.00 is offered a 10% discount. The function call would be:

```python
discount = calculateDiscount(200.0, 0.1)
print(discount)  # Output: 20.0
```

The output indicates that the customer will save $20.00 on the item.

## Conclusion

`calculateDiscount` is a straightforward function for computing discounts based on an item's original price and discount rate. It is useful in various financial and retail applications where accurate discount calculations are required.
***
### FunctionDef num_actions(self)
**num_actions**: The function of num_actions is to calculate the total number of possible actions on the Tic Tac Toe board.
**parameters**: 
· self: The instance of the class, required for all methods within the class.

**Code Description**: This method calculates and returns the total number of possible actions available on a Tic Tac Toe board. It does so by multiplying the number of columns (`self.num_cols`) with the number of rows (`self.num_rows`). In the context of Tic Tac Toe, this would be 3 * 3 = 9, as there are 3 rows and 3 columns.

**Note**: Ensure that `num_cols` and `num_rows` have been properly initialized before calling `num_actions`. If they are not set correctly, this method will return an incorrect number of actions. Also, note that the function does not account for any game state; it simply returns the theoretical maximum number of moves.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming self.num_cols = 3 and self.num_rows = 3
print(tic_tac_toe_game.num_actions())  # Output: 9
```
***
### FunctionDef invalid_actions(self)
**invalid_actions**: The function of invalid_actions is to return an array indicating which actions are invalid based on the current state of the board.
**parameters**: 
· self: A reference to the TicTacToeGame instance.

**Code Description**: This method checks the current state of the game board and returns a boolean array where each element corresponds to whether that action (position) has already been taken. Specifically, it uses the condition `self.board != 0` to identify positions on the board that are not empty, meaning they have already been played in the game. The result is an array with values of either True or False for each position on the board, where True indicates the action is invalid (the position has been taken), and False indicates it is valid.

The `self.board` attribute likely contains information about the current state of the TicTacToeGame board, possibly represented as a 3x3 array with values indicating which player's mark (or no mark) occupies each position. The condition `self.board != 0` checks if any value in this array is non-zero, meaning that position has been used.

**Note**: 
- Ensure the `board` attribute correctly reflects the current state of the game.
- This method assumes the board index starts from 1 to 9, corresponding to positions (0, 0) through (2, 2).

**Output Example**: If the current board state is `[1, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 0]`, then `invalid_actions` would return an array like `[True, False, False, True, False, False, True, True, True]`. This indicates that positions 1 and 5 are invalid (already taken), while the rest are valid.
***
### FunctionDef reset(self)
**reset**: The function of reset is to initialize or restart the game state.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `reset` method in the `TicTacToeGame` class is responsible for resetting the game board and related states to their initial conditions. When called, it sets up a fresh game by performing the following actions:
- **Board Initialization**: The attribute `self.board`, which represents the current state of the game board, is reset to an array filled with zeros using `jnp.zeros`. This means all positions on the board are initially empty.
- **Player Turn Setup**: The variable `self.who_play` indicates whose turn it is to play next. It is set to 1, typically representing player X in a Tic-Tac-Toe game.
- **Game Termination Check**: The boolean value of `self.terminated` is reset to False (`0` in numpy), indicating that the game has not yet ended.
- **Winner Declaration Reset**: The variable `self.winner` is set to 0, meaning no player has won the game so far.
- **Move Count Initialization**: Finally, `self.count` is reset to 0, keeping track of the number of moves made in the current game.

This method ensures that all necessary states are properly initialized whenever a new game starts or an existing game needs to be restarted. It is called by the constructor (`__init__`) during object initialization and can also be used manually if needed to restart the game from scratch.
**Note**: Ensure that this function is called appropriately after any scenario where the game state needs to be reset, such as starting a new game or restarting an interrupted one. Misuse of this method could lead to incorrect game states, affecting gameplay and outcomes.

***
### FunctionDef render(self)
**render**: The function of render is to display the current state of the TicTacToeGame on the screen.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: self - An instance of the TicTacToeGame class.

**Code Description**: 
The `render` method within the `TicTacToeGame` class is responsible for rendering the game board in a readable format. It first retrieves the current state of the game board using the `observation()` method, which reshapes the internal representation of the board to match the expected output format.

Here is a detailed analysis of each part of the code:

1. **board = self.observation()**: This line calls the `observation` method on the instance of `TicTacToeGame`. The `observation` method reshapes the game board from its internal representation (typically stored as a flattened array) to a 2D array with dimensions `(num_rows, num_cols)`, making it suitable for rendering.

2. **for row in reversed(range(self.num_rows)):**: This loop iterates over each row of the board in reverse order. Iterating in reverse ensures that the last move is displayed at the top of the output, which is a common convention in Tic-Tac-Toe games to show recent moves first.

3. **for col in range(self.num_cols):**: Within the outer loop, this inner loop iterates over each column in the current row.

4. **if board[row, col].item() == 1: print("X", end=" ")**: This conditional checks if the current cell contains a value of `1`, which represents player X. If true, it prints "X" followed by a space to separate cells horizontally.

5. **elif board[row, col].item() == -1: print("O", end=" ")**: This conditional checks if the current cell contains a value of `-1`, representing player O. If true, it prints "O" followed by a space.

6. **else: print(".", end=" ")**: For any other value in the board (typically `0` for an empty cell), this line prints a period "." to represent an empty cell.

7. **print()**: After processing all columns in a row, this line is used to move to the next line and start printing the next row.

8. **print()**: Finally, another print statement is used to add an extra newline at the end of the board representation for better readability.

The `render` method provides a simple text-based visualization of the game state, making it easy for users to understand the current position on the board and follow the ongoing gameplay. This output can be particularly useful during debugging or when testing the game logic interactively.

**Note**: Ensure that the reshaped array from `observation()` correctly represents the game state with values 1 and -1 corresponding to player X and O, respectively, while 0 indicates an empty cell. This ensures accurate rendering of the board for users.
***
### FunctionDef observation(self)
**observation**: The function of observation is to reshape the board array to match the expected output format.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: self - An instance of the TicTacToeGame class.

**Code Description**: 
The `observation` method within the `TicTacToeGame` class reshapes the current state of the game board. The board is initially stored as a 2D array, but it needs to be reshaped into an array with the shape `(num_rows, num_cols)` to match the expected output format for rendering or other purposes.

The method first retrieves the current state of the board using `self.board`. It then uses NumPy's `reshape` function to change the shape of this array. The new shape is determined by concatenating all dimensions except the last one with the specified number of rows and columns (`self.num_rows` and `self.num_cols`). This ensures that the reshaped board has the correct dimensions for further processing or display.

The relationship between the `observation` method and its callers in the project can be understood as follows:
- **Step Method**: The `step` method calls `self.observation()` to get the current state of the game after an action is taken. This observation is then used to determine if there is a winner, update rewards, or check for termination conditions.
- **Render Method**: The `render` method also calls `self.observation()`, which provides it with the board state in a format that can be easily printed to the screen.

**Note**: Ensure that the reshaped array maintains the correct representation of the game board. Specifically, the values 1 and -1 should correspond to player X and O respectively, while 0 represents an empty cell.

**Output Example**: If the current board state is represented as a 2D array `board` with dimensions `(3, 3)` (i.e., a 3x3 grid), calling `observation()` would return this same data but reshaped to match the expected output format for rendering or further processing. For example, if the board currently looks like:
```
[[1, -1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [-1, 0, 0]]
```
The `observation` method would return this same data but reshaped to a `(3, 3)` array, ensuring compatibility with rendering or other methods that expect a specific format.
***
### FunctionDef canonical_observation(self)
**canonical_observation**: The function of canonical_observation is to transform the game board into a standardized format.

**Parameters**:
· parameter1: self - An instance of the TicTacToeGame class.

**Code Description**: 
The `canonical_observation` method within the `TicTacToeGame` class converts the current state of the game board into a standard array representation. This transformation ensures that the board can be used consistently across different parts of the application, such as rendering or decision-making processes.

1. **Retrieving the Board State**: The method starts by accessing the current state of the game board through `self.board`. This board is typically represented as a 2D NumPy array where each cell contains one of three values: 1 (player X), -1 (player O), or 0 (empty).

2. **Reshaping the Array**: The method then reshapes this 2D array into a canonical form using `self.who_play` as a multiplier. This step is crucial for aligning the board representation with specific requirements, such as rendering or processing by other methods.

3. **Multiplying by `who_play`**: The variable `self.who_play` holds the current player's identity (1 for X and -1 for O). Multiplying the reshaped board array by this value ensures that the canonical observation reflects the perspective of the active player. For instance, if it is player X’s turn (`self.who_play == 1`), the board will be returned in a form where all cells controlled by X are marked with positive values and those controlled by O (or empty) with negative or zero values.

4. **Return Value**: The method returns the transformed observation as a `chex.Array`, which is a type-annotated array from the `jaxtyping` library, ensuring that the returned value has the correct shape and data type expected by other parts of the application.

The relationship between the `canonical_observation` method and its callees in the project can be understood as follows:
- **Decision-Making Methods**: The canonical observation is used by methods that make decisions based on the current game state, such as checking for a win or determining the next move. By standardizing the board representation, these methods can operate consistently regardless of whose turn it is.
- **Rendering Methods**: The transformed observation is also valuable for rendering purposes, ensuring that the game display accurately reflects the current state from the perspective of the active player.

**Note**: Ensure that the canonical observation properly represents the game state. Specifically, the values should correctly reflect the positions controlled by each player and be compatible with any subsequent processing or rendering requirements.

**Output Example**: If the current board state is represented as a 2D array `board` with dimensions `(3, 3)` (i.e., a 3x3 grid), calling `canonical_observation()` would return this same data but reshaped to match the expected output format. For example, if the board currently looks like:
```
[[1, -1, 0],
 [0, 1, 0],
 [-1, 0, 0]]
```
The `canonical_observation` method might return a similar array after multiplication by `self.who_play`, ensuring that it is in the correct format for further processing or rendering.

### FunctionDef is_terminated(self)
**is_terminated**: The function of is_terminated is to check whether the game has reached a terminal state.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `is_terminated` method checks if the current state of the TicTacToeGame instance represents a terminated (or complete) state. It returns the value stored in the `self.terminated` attribute, which is typically set based on game logic to indicate whether the game has ended due to a win, draw, or other termination conditions.

The `is_terminated` method is called during each turn of the game to determine if further moves are necessary. If the game state indicates that the game is already terminated (e.g., one player has won, or all cells are filled), no further actions are required, and the game can transition to a post-game phase such as displaying the result or asking for another round.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.terminated` is properly updated based on the game rules before calling this method. The value of `self.terminated` should be set to `True` when the game reaches a terminal state and `False` otherwise.
**Output Example**: 
```python
# Example 1: Game has ended due to a win condition
game = TicTacToeGame()
# Assume player X wins after several moves
game.set_winner("X")
game.is_terminated()  # Returns True

# Example 2: Game is still in progress
game.reset()
game.is_terminated()  # Returns False
```

### FunctionDef max_num_steps(self)
**max_num_steps**: The function of max_num_steps is to determine the maximum number of steps that can be taken in a TicTacToeGame.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `max_num_steps` method calculates and returns the total number of possible moves (steps) in a game of Tic Tac Toe. It does this by multiplying the number of columns (`self.num_cols`) with the number of rows (`self.num_rows`). In a standard 3x3 Tic Tac Toe board, for example, `max_num_steps` would return 9, as there are nine possible positions where a player can place their mark.
The method is straightforward and leverages the dimensions of the game grid to provide an upper limit on the number of moves. This value is useful in various contexts, such as determining when the game has ended or implementing strategies that depend on the total number of available moves.

**Note**: 
- Ensure `num_cols` and `num_rows` are set correctly before calling this method.
- The returned value represents the maximum possible steps; it does not account for any actual player moves or game state changes during gameplay.

**Output Example**: If a TicTacToeGame instance is initialized with 3 columns and 3 rows, then `max_num_steps()` will return `9`.

### FunctionDef symmetries(self, state, action_weights)
**symmetries**: The function of symmetries is to apply various symmetry transformations (rotations and reflections) to a game state and its associated action weights.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: state - A 2D numpy array representing the current state of the TicTacToe game board.
· parameter2: action_weights - A 1D or 2D numpy array containing the weights associated with each possible action in the game.

**Code Description**: The function `symmetries` performs symmetry transformations on both the game state and its corresponding action weights. It applies four rotations (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°) to the input state and action weights array, followed by a horizontal flip for each rotated version of the state and action weights.

1. The function first reshapes `action_weights` into a 2D numpy array with dimensions `(num_rows, num_cols)` using the game's board size.
2. It initializes an empty list `out` to store the transformed states and their corresponding action weights.
3. For each rotation (0°, 90°, 180°, and 270°), it rotates both the state and action weights by the specified angle using `np.rot90`.
4. It appends a tuple containing the rotated state and reshaped action weights to the list `out`.
5. After rotating, it performs a horizontal flip on the rotated state and action weights.
6. The flipped version of the state and action weights are also appended as another tuple to the list `out`.
7. Finally, the function returns the list `out` containing all transformed states and their corresponding action weights.

**Note**: Ensure that the input `state` is a 2D numpy array with dimensions `(num_rows, num_cols)` matching the game's board size. The `action_weights` should be either a 1D or 2D numpy array depending on how they are defined in your implementation.

**Output Example**: For an initial state and action weights array, the function might return something like:
```
[
    (rotated_state_0, rotated_action_weights_0.reshape((-1,))),
    (rotated_state_90, rotated_action_weights_90.reshape((-1,))),
    (rotated_state_180, rotated_action_weights_180.reshape((-1,))),
    (rotated_state_270, rotated_action_weights_270.reshape((-1,))),
    (flipped_rotated_state_0, flipped_rotated_action_weights_0.reshape((-1,))),
    (flipped_rotated_state_90, flipped_rotated_action_weights_90.reshape((-1,))),
    (flipped_rotated_state_180, flipped_rotated_action_weights_180.reshape((-1,))),
    (flipped_rotated_state_270, flipped_rotated_action_weights_270.reshape((-1,)))
]
```
Each element in the list is a tuple containing a transformed state and its corresponding reshaped action weights.
