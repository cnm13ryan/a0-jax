## ClassDef CheckerTestData
**CheckerTestData**: The function of CheckerTestData is to store test data for board game scenarios where two players are trying to connect their pieces on a grid.

**Attributes**:
路 parameter1: `board` - A list representing the state of the game board, where each element corresponds to a cell on the board. Typically, this could be an integer indicating which player owns that cell or some other representation.
路 parameter2: `expected` - An integer representing the expected outcome for a given test case. This could indicate the winning player number or another relevant result based on the game rules.

**Code Description**: The CheckerTestData class is defined as a NamedTuple, inheriting from Python's built-in collections.namedtuple. This means that instances of CheckerTestData will have named fields corresponding to the parameters provided during instantiation. By using a NamedTuple, the class provides a convenient and efficient way to create simple data classes with fixed field names.

The `board` attribute is expected to be a list where each element represents a cell on the game board. The exact nature of what these integers represent (e.g., player 1's piece, player 2's piece) would depend on the specific implementation of the game being tested. This allows for flexible and clear representation of different board states.

The `expected` attribute is an integer that specifies the expected outcome of a test case. This could be used to check if the game logic correctly identifies when two players have connected their pieces or if there are other outcomes like draws, invalid moves, etc. By storing this information alongside the board state, it becomes straightforward to validate the correctness of the game's decision-making process.

**Note**: When using CheckerTestData in your tests, ensure that both `board` and `expected` values accurately represent valid scenarios from the game. This will help in thoroughly testing different aspects of the game logic without missing edge cases or incorrect assumptions about the board state.
## FunctionDef test_win_checker(board, expected)
**test_win_checker**: The function of test_win_checker is to verify if the Connect2WinChecker class correctly identifies the winner in a Connect-2 game based on the given board configuration.

**Parameters**:
路 parameter1: `board` (List[int]) - A 1D list representing the current state of the game board.
路 parameter2: `expected` (int) - The expected result indicating whether player 1 (+1), player 2 (-1), or no one (0) has won.

**Code Description**: 
The `test_win_checker` function serves as a test case to ensure that the Connect2WinChecker class functions correctly by providing it with a game board configuration and checking if its output matches the expected result. Here is a detailed breakdown of how this function works:

1. **Initialization and Setup**:
   - The function starts by creating an instance of the `Connect2WinChecker` class.
   
2. **Board Conversion**:
   - The input `board`, which is provided as a list of integers, is converted to a 3D array suitable for processing by the convolutional layer. This conversion involves adding extra dimensions and converting data types to float32.

3. **Convolution Operation**:
   - The board is passed through the convolutional layer (`self.conv`). The convolution operation scans the board using a kernel of size 2, which helps in identifying consecutive elements.
   
4. **Win Condition Checking**:
   - After the convolution operation, the function checks if any two consecutive elements are both `1` (indicating player 1 has won) or `-1` (indicating player 2 has won).
   - If a match is found, the corresponding score (+1 for player 1, -1 for player 2) is returned.
   - If no such condition is met, the function returns `0`, indicating an undecided outcome.

5. **Assertion**:
   - The result of the `Connect2WinChecker` class is compared against the expected value using an assertion statement. This ensures that the test case passes if the actual output matches the expected result.
   
The relationship with its callees in the project can be seen from the fact that this function is part of a broader testing framework, likely used to validate various scenarios and edge cases for the Connect2WinChecker class.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the board configurations provided during testing are representative of different game states (e.g., winning conditions, draws).
- Pay attention to the data types and dimensions when converting the input board to a format suitable for convolutional processing.
- The test case should cover a variety of scenarios to thoroughly validate the functionality of Connect2WinChecker.
