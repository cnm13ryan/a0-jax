## ClassDef Connect2WinChecker
**Connect2WinChecker**: The function of Connect2WinChecker is to determine the winner in a Connect-2 game by analyzing the board using a 1D convolution.

**attributes**: The attributes of this Class include:
· `conv`: A 1D Convolutional layer used for scanning the board. It has been initialized with specific weights to detect winning conditions.
· No explicitly defined instance variables are shown in the class definition, but it likely uses internal state managed by the underlying framework.

**Code Description**: The Connect2WinChecker class is designed to identify if either player 1 or player 2 has won a game of Connect-2. Here's a detailed breakdown:

The constructor (`__init__`) initializes the module and sets up the convolutional layer with specific weights:
```python
def __init__(self):
    super().__init__()
    conv = pax.Conv1D(1, 1, 2, padding="VALID")
    weight = jnp.array([1.0, 1.0], dtype=conv.weight.dtype)
    weight = weight.reshape(conv.weight.shape)
    self.conv = conv.replace(weight=weight)
```
- `pax.Conv1D` creates a 1D convolutional layer with one input channel and one output channel.
- The kernel size is set to 2, meaning it will scan two consecutive elements of the board at once.
- The weights are initialized as `[1.0, 1.0]`, which effectively means that if both elements in the window are `1` (indicating player 1), or `-1` (indicating player 2), a match is found.

The main functionality is implemented in the `__call__` method:
```python
def __call__(self, board: chex.Array) -> chex.Array:
    board = board[None, :, None].astype(jnp.float32)
    x = self.conv(board)
    is_p1_won: chex.Array = jnp.max(x) == 2  # 1 + 1
    is_p2_won: chex.Array = jnp.min(x) == -2  # -1 + -1
    return is_p1_won * 1 + is_p2_won * (-1)
```
- The input `board` is reshaped and converted to float32 for compatibility with the convolutional layer.
- The board is passed through the convolutional layer, resulting in an output array `x`.
- The maximum value in `x` is checked to see if it equals 2 (indicating a win by player 1).
- Similarly, the minimum value in `x` is checked to see if it equals -2 (indicating a win by player 2).
- If either condition is met, the method returns the corresponding score (+1 for player 1, -1 for player 2). Otherwise, it returns 0 indicating no winner.

This class is called within the `Connect2Game` initialization to set up the game's winner checker. The `test_win_checker` function in the test module verifies its correctness by providing sample boards and expected outcomes.

**Note**: Ensure that the input board is properly formatted as a 1D array of integers before passing it to the `Connect2WinChecker`. Any incorrect formatting may lead to unexpected results.

**Output Example**: If the input board is `[1, 1, -1]`, the output will be `+1` because both elements in the window are `1`, indicating a win by player 1. If the board is `[1, -1, -1]`, the output will be `-1` because there's a sequence of two consecutive `-1`s, indicating a win by player 2. For any other input where no winning condition is met, the output will be `0`.
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Connect2WinChecker class.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters other than `self`.
**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the `Connect2WinChecker` class. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Superclass Initialization**: The first line, `super().__init__()`, calls the constructor of the superclass (presumably another class in the inheritance hierarchy). This ensures that any necessary initialization from the parent class is performed.

2. **Convolutional Layer Creation**: 
   ```python
   conv = pax.Conv1D(1, 1, 2, padding="VALID")
   ```
   - `pax.Conv1D` creates a one-dimensional convolutional layer.
   - Parameters:
     - The first argument (1) specifies the number of output channels.
     - The second argument (1) indicates that each filter has only one input channel.
     - The third argument (2) sets the kernel size, meaning each filter will be applied over 2 elements in the input sequence.
     - `padding="VALID"` means no padding is added around the edges of the input.

3. **Weight Initialization**:
   ```python
   weight = jnp.array([1.0, 1.0], dtype=conv.weight.dtype)
   ```
   - A NumPy array (`jnp.array`) with two elements (both set to 1.0) is created.
   - The `dtype` parameter ensures that the array has the same data type as the weight tensor of the convolutional layer.

4. **Reshaping and Weight Replacement**:
   ```python
   weight = weight.reshape(conv.weight.shape)
   self.conv = conv.replace(weight=weight)
   ```
   - The array is reshaped to match the shape of the `conv` layer’s weight tensor.
   - Finally, the `replace` method on the convolutional layer object updates its weights with the newly initialized values.

This initialization process sets up a custom convolutional layer within the `Connect2WinChecker` class, allowing for specific behavior in subsequent operations or checks related to the game Connect Two. The use of predefined weights might be part of an experiment or a specific requirement for the game logic.

**Note**: Ensure that all necessary imports (`pax`, `jnp`) are included at the top of your file and that the class hierarchy is correctly defined elsewhere in your codebase. Additionally, this initialization step should align with the overall design goals of the `Connect2WinChecker` class to avoid runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

### FunctionDef __call__(self, board)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to evaluate whether a given game board configuration indicates a win condition for either player.

**parameters**: 
· parameter1: board (chex.Array) - A 2D array representing the current state of the game board, where different values might represent empty spaces, player 1's moves, and player 2's moves.

**Code Description**: The __call__ function processes a given game board to determine if either player has won. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Board Preparation**: 
   - `board = board[None, :, None].astype(jnp.float32)`:
     - This line adds an extra dimension to the input board and converts its data type to float32 for further processing.
     - The use of `[None, :, None]` effectively transforms a 2D array into a 4D array with shape (1, rows, columns, 1), which is necessary for passing it through convolutional layers.

2. **Convolution Operation**:
   - `x = self.conv(board)`:
     - The prepared board is passed through the convolutional layer (`self.conv`), which likely detects patterns or features relevant to determining a win condition.

3. **Win Condition Check for Player 1**:
   - `is_p1_won: chex.Array = jnp.max(x) == 2 # 1 + 1`:
     - This line checks if the maximum value in the output tensor `x` is 2, which would indicate that player 1 has won. The condition `1 + 1` suggests a scoring system where winning for player 1 might be represented by a sum of 2.

4. **Win Condition Check for Player 2**:
   - `is_p2_won: chex.Array = jnp.min(x) == -2 # -1 + -1`:
     - Similarly, this line checks if the minimum value in the output tensor `x` is -2, indicating that player 2 has won. The condition `-1 + -1` suggests a scoring system where winning for player 2 might be represented by a sum of -2.

5. **Return Value Calculation**:
   - `return is_p1_won * 1 + is_p2_won * (-1)`:
     - If player 1 has won (`is_p1_won` is True), the function returns 1.
     - If player 2 has won (`is_p2_won` is True), the function returns -1.
     - If neither condition is met, the function implicitly returns 0 (not explicitly shown).

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input `board` is of the correct shape and data type before calling this method. Incorrect dimensions or types can lead to errors during processing.
- The specific values used in the conditions (`2` for player 1 and `-2` for player 2) are hard-coded and should be consistent with the game's scoring rules.

**Output Example**: 
If `board` is a configuration where player 1 has won, the function might return `1`. If player 2 has won, it would return `-1`. In all other cases (no winner), the output could be `0`, though this value is not explicitly returned in the given code.

***
### FunctionDef num_actions(self)
**num_actions**: The function of num_actions is to return the number of possible actions in the Connect2Game.
**parameters**: 
· self: The instance of the Connect2Game class.

**Code Description**: 
The `num_actions` method returns an integer value representing the total number of valid moves available in the current state of the game. In a standard Connect2Game, this is typically 4 positions where a player can place their token (top-left, top-middle, top-right, bottom-center). This method ensures that both players and the game logic are aware of the possible actions at any given time.

In the context of the project, `num_actions` plays a crucial role in determining the number of valid moves available to the current player. It is called during each turn to verify if a move is within the allowed actions before updating the game state. The method guarantees that all actions are consistent with the rules of the Connect2Game, ensuring fair and balanced gameplay.

**Note**: Ensure that `num_actions` is always called when determining valid moves to maintain consistency in the game's logic. This function should not be modified or bypassed as it directly impacts the game's fairness and integrity.

**Output Example**: The output of this method will always be 4, indicating that there are four possible actions available in a standard Connect2Game setup.
***
### FunctionDef invalid_actions(self)
**invalid_actions**: The function of invalid_actions is to return an array indicating which actions are invalid based on the current state of the game board.
**parameters**:
· self: A reference to the instance of Connect2Game, allowing access to its attributes and methods.

**Code Description**: 
The `invalid_actions` method checks if any positions on the game board are already occupied (i.e., not equal to 0). If a position is occupied, it marks that action as invalid. The function returns an array where each element corresponds to a possible action in the game, with a value of 1 indicating an invalid action and 0 indicating a valid action.

The method works by comparing the current state of the board (`self.board`) against zero. If any position on the board is not equal to zero (meaning it's already occupied), that position (or action) is marked as invalid, resulting in a value of 1 for that corresponding element in the returned array.

For example, if the game board has 9 positions and the first three are occupied, the method will return an array `[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`, indicating that actions 1-3 are invalid.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `self.board` is properly initialized before calling this function.
- The returned array should be interpreted in the context of the game's action space. For instance, if each position on the board corresponds to an action index, the output directly maps which indices represent invalid actions.

**Output Example**: Given a 3x3 game board where positions `[0, 1, 2]` are occupied, the function could return:
```
[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```
***
### FunctionDef reset(self)
**reset**: The function of reset is to initialize or restart the game state.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `reset` method in the `Connect2Game` class is responsible for resetting all the game-related states back to their initial values. It initializes several key attributes:

- **self.board = jnp.zeros((4,), dtype=jnp.int32)**: This line sets the game board state to an array of zeros, indicating that no moves have been made yet.
- **self.who_play = jnp.array(1, dtype=jnp.int32)**: The `who_play` attribute is set to 1, which typically represents Player 1 or the first player in a two-player game.
- **self.count = jnp.array(0, dtype=jnp.int32)**: This initializes the move count to zero, keeping track of how many moves have been made so far.
- **self.terminated = jnp.array(0, dtype=jnp.bool_)**: The `terminated` attribute is set to False (represented by 0), indicating that the game has not ended yet.
- **self.winner = jnp.array(0, dtype=jnp.int32)**: This resets the winner status to zero, meaning no player has won the game.

This method is called during the initialization of a new `Connect2Game` instance and can also be used to restart the game after it has been terminated. The caller in this project first calls the `reset` method within its own constructor (`__init__`) before setting up other attributes like `winner_checker`.

**Note**: Ensure that when calling `reset`, you are not inadvertently resetting any state that should persist across multiple games, such as the game's rules or win conditions. Additionally, be aware of how this reset interacts with other methods and attributes in the class to maintain a consistent game state throughout its lifecycle.
***
### FunctionDef step(self, action)
**step**: The function of `step` is to advance one step in the Connect2Game by making a move.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: game (Connect2Game instance)
· parameter2: action (jnp.array): An integer representing the position on the board where the player wants to place their token.

**Code Description**: The `step` function is responsible for advancing one step in the Connect2Game by making a move. It takes the current state of the game and an action as input, updates the game state based on the given action, and returns the new game state along with any associated rewards or termination information.

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the provided `action` is within valid bounds (0 to 3) using a boolean mask (`valid_action_mask`). This ensures that only legal moves are made.
2. **Board Update**: If the action is valid, it updates the board by placing the current player's token (1 for Player 1 and -1 for Player 2) in the specified position.
3. **Check Termination Conditions**: After updating the board, the function checks if the game has ended due to a win or draw condition using the `check_termination` method. If the game is terminated, it sets the `terminated` attribute accordingly.
4. **Reward Calculation**: The function calculates and returns any associated rewards. For example, if a player wins, the reward will be 1; otherwise, if an invalid move is made, the reward will be -1.

The function also updates the current player's turn using the `switch_player` method to ensure that the next step involves the other player making their move.

**Note**: Ensure that the action provided is within valid bounds (0 to 3). Invalid actions will result in a reward of -1 and will terminate the game. The function assumes that the board state and current player are correctly set up before calling `step`.

**Output Example**: 
```python
game, reward = game.step(action)
```
- If action is valid and leads to a win: `reward == 1` and `game.terminated == True`.
- If action is invalid (out of bounds): `reward == -1` and `game.terminated == True`.
- If the move does not result in an immediate termination: `reward == 0` and `game.terminated == False`.
***
### FunctionDef render(self)
**render**: The function of render is to display the current state of the game board on the screen.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `render` method is responsible for visually representing the current state of the Connect2Game instance on the console. It first prints a header row with numbers from 0 to 3, likely indicating column indices or positions. Then, it iterates over each element in the game board (`self.board`) and prints 'X', 'O', or '.' based on the value stored at that position.

- The line `print("0 1 2 3")` outputs a header row with numbers corresponding to the columns of the game board.
- A loop runs from `i = 0` to `N - 1`, where `N` is the length of `self.board`. This loop iterates over each position on the game board.
- Inside the loop, it checks the value at `self.board[i]`:
  - If the value is `1`, it prints 'X'.
  - If the value is `-1`, it prints 'O'.
  - Otherwise, if neither condition is met (i.e., the value is `0`), it prints '.'.
- The `end=" "` parameter in `print("X", end=" ")` and similar lines ensures that each character is printed on the same line with a space between them.
- After printing all elements of the current row, `print()` is called to move to the next line, effectively creating a new row for the next iteration.

**Note**: The function assumes that `self.board` contains either `1`, `-1`, or `0`. If any other value exists in `self.board`, it will be printed as a dot ('.'). This could lead to unexpected visual representation if not all values are handled appropriately. Additionally, the header row is hardcoded and only supports a board size of 4 (as indicated by the range from 0 to 3). If the game board size changes, this function would need to be adjusted accordingly.
***
### FunctionDef observation(self)
**observation**: The function of observation is to return the current state of the game board.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `observation` method returns the current state of the game board stored within the instance of the `Connect2Game` class. Specifically, it accesses and returns the `board` attribute which represents the current configuration or state of the game board.

In detail:
- The function is defined as a method within the `Connect2Game` class.
- It uses the `chex.Array` return type annotation to indicate that the returned value should be an array-like object, likely representing the game board in a structured format suitable for further processing or analysis.
- By returning `self.board`, it provides access to the internal state of the game, allowing other parts of the codebase (or external components) to inspect the current state of the game board without needing to know its internal structure.

**Note**: Ensure that the `board` attribute is correctly initialized and updated during gameplay. Any changes to the game state should be reflected in this attribute for accurate observation.

**Output Example**: A possible return value could be a 2D array or list representing the current state of the game board, where each element might correspond to a cell on the board, possibly indicating whether it is empty, occupied by player 1, or occupied by player 2. For example:
```
[
    [0, 1, -1],
    [-1, 0, 1],
    [1, -1, 0]
]
``` 
Here, `0` could represent an empty cell, `1` a cell occupied by player 1, and `-1` a cell occupied by player 2.
***
### FunctionDef canonical_observation(self)
**canonical_observation**: The function of canonical_observation is to return the current state of the game board as an array, scaled by the player whose turn it currently is.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters other than `self`, which refers to the instance of the Connect2Game class.
**Code Description**: 
The `canonical_observation` method returns a chex.Array (a type of NumPy array with additional type checking) that represents the current state of the game board. The returned observation is scaled by the player identifier (`self.who_play`) which indicates whose turn it currently is. This means if `self.who_play` is 1, the board will be returned as is; if it's -1, the board might be flipped or transformed in some way to represent the perspective of the other player.
The core logic of this method is simply multiplying the current state of the game board (`self.board`) by the player identifier (`self.who_play`). This multiplication effectively scales the board representation based on whose turn it currently is.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.board` and `self.who_play` are correctly initialized and updated throughout the game to provide accurate observations.
**Output Example**: If `self.board` is a 6x7 array representing a Connect4 game state, and `self.who_play` is 1 (indicating it's Player 1's turn), then the output of `canonical_observation()` would be the same 6x7 array as `self.board`. If `self.who_play` were -1, the method might return a modified or transformed version of `self.board` to indicate the perspective of Player 2.

### FunctionDef is_terminated(self)
**is_terminated**: The function of is_terminated is to check whether the game has ended.
**parameters**: 
· self: The instance of Connect2Game that the method belongs to.

**Code Description**: This method `is_terminated` checks if the game has reached a termination state, returning a boolean value. It does so by accessing and returning the value stored in the `self.terminated` attribute. 

The implementation is straightforward:
1. The method takes only one parameter, which is `self`, indicating it's an instance method of the Connect2Game class.
2. Inside the method, it simply returns the boolean value stored in `self.terminated`. This attribute likely indicates whether the game has concluded due to a win condition or some other end-game scenario.

**Note**: Ensure that `self.terminated` is properly set based on the game's logic to accurately determine if the game should be considered terminated. If not, this method might return incorrect results.
**Output Example**: 
```python
# Assuming self.terminated is False (game is ongoing)
print(is_terminated())  # Output: False

# Assuming self.terminated is True (game has ended)
print(is_terminated())  # Output: True
```

### FunctionDef max_num_steps(self)
**max_num_steps**: The function of max_num_steps is to return the maximum number of steps allowed in the game.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `max_num_steps` method returns an integer value representing the maximum number of steps that can be taken during a game session. In this specific implementation, it always returns 4, indicating that players are limited to making up to four moves in total throughout their gameplay.

This method is likely used as part of the state management or rules enforcement within the Connect2Game class. It could be called at various points during the game's execution to ensure that no player exceeds the allowed number of steps and to maintain the integrity of the game's constraints.
**Note**: The value returned by `max_num_steps` is hardcoded to 4, meaning this limit cannot be changed without modifying the code. Ensure that any changes to this constant are carefully considered in light of the overall game design and rules.

**Output Example**: 
```python
print(max_num_steps())  # Output: 4
```

### FunctionDef symmetries(self, state, action_weights)
**symmetries**: The function of symmetries is to return a list of symmetric states derived from the input state and action weights.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: state - A game state represented as an array or matrix.
· parameter2: action_weights - An array representing the weights associated with possible actions in the given state.

**Code Description**: The function `symmetries` takes a current game state (`state`) and its corresponding action weights (`action_weights`). It returns a list containing two elements, each of which is a tuple. Each tuple consists of a symmetrically transformed version of the input state and the corresponding flipped action weights.

1. **First Element**: The first element in the returned list is simply the original `state` and `action_weights`.
2. **Second Element**: The second element contains the result of flipping both the `state` and `action_weights`. Flipping here implies reversing or mirroring the state array, which could be achieved using NumPy's `np.flip()` function.

By returning these transformed states, the function allows for consideration of symmetrical game states, which can be useful in various game-playing algorithms to account for equivalent positions that might arise due to rotations or reflections. This approach helps in reducing redundancy and improving the efficiency of search strategies.

**Note**: Ensure that `state` is a valid array representation of the game state, and `action_weights` are appropriately sized arrays corresponding to the actions available from the given state. The use of NumPy's `np.flip()` function requires this library to be imported at the beginning of your script or module.

**Output Example**: Given an input state `[1, 2, 3]` and action weights `[0.5, 0.3, 0.2]`, the output could be:
```
[([1, 2, 3], [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]), ([3, 2, 1], [0.2, 0.3, 0.5])]
```
