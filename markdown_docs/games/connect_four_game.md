## ClassDef Connect4WinChecker
**Connect4WinChecker**: The function of Connect4WinChecker is to determine if any player has won the game by detecting four consecutive tokens either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a Connect Four board.

**attributes**: 
· conv: A 2D convolutional layer used for pattern recognition.
· weight: Filter weights initialized based on winning patterns.

**Code Description**: The `Connect4WinChecker` class is responsible for checking if a player has won the game by scanning through the game board. It utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with specific filters to identify four consecutive tokens, which indicate a win. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:
   - The `Connect4WinChecker` is initialized using its superclass constructor.
   - A 2D convolutional layer `conv` is created with the following specifications: input channels of 1 (representing the game board), output channels of 6, kernel size of 4x4, and valid padding. This setup allows the network to scan through the entire board efficiently.
   - The `weight` matrix is initialized as a zero array of shape `(4, 4, 1, 6)`, which represents the filter weights for detecting winning patterns. Each pattern corresponds to one output channel:
     - Four horizontal filters (`1 0 0 0` repeated in different positions).
     - Four vertical filters (`0 0 0 1` repeated in different positions).
     - Two diagonal filters (`1 1 1 1` for positive diagonals and `1 0 0 1` for negative diagonals, rearranged to fit the kernel size).

2. **Forward Pass (`__call__` method)**:
   - The game board is passed as input, which needs to be reshaped into a 4D tensor `[batch_size=1, num_rows, num_cols, channels=1]`.
   - The `board` is converted to float32 data type for compatibility with the convolution operation.
   - The convolutional layer `conv` processes the board, producing an output tensor of shape `[1, 6, 4, 4]` where each element corresponds to a filter's activation map on the board.
   - The maximum absolute value (`m`) across all channels is calculated. This value indicates the strongest match with any winning pattern.
   - If `m` equals 4 (indicating four consecutive tokens in one of the patterns), then the output is set to `1` for the corresponding player and `-1` otherwise, representing a win or non-win state.

3. **Integration with Connect4Game**:
   The `Connect4WinChecker` class is used within the `Connect4Game` class during initialization (`__init__`). It sets up the checker as part of the game's state management system to continuously monitor for wins throughout the game.
   
**Note**: Ensure that the input board passed to `Connect4WinChecker` is properly formatted and updated after each move in the game.

**Output Example**: Given a 6x7 Connect Four board, if player tokens form four consecutive pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, the output would be an array indicating the winning condition. For example:
```
[1] # Player 1 wins
[-1] # Player 2 wins
[0] # No winner yet
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Connect4WinChecker class by setting up a convolutional layer and its corresponding weights.

**parameters**: This method does not take any parameters as it is called implicitly when an instance of the `Connect4WinChecker` class is created.

**Code Description**: 
The provided code initializes the `Connect4WinChecker` class. Here's a detailed analysis:

1. **Superclass Initialization**: The first line, `super().__init__()`, calls the constructor of the superclass (likely from a parent class or another base class), ensuring that any necessary initialization for inherited attributes and methods is performed.

2. **Convolutional Layer Setup**: A convolutional layer (`conv`) is created using `pax.Conv2D(1, 6, 4, padding="VALID")`. This line specifies:
   - The input channels (1),
   - The number of output channels (6),
   - The kernel size (4x4), and
   - Valid padding.

3. **Weight Initialization**: A weight matrix `weight` is initialized as a zero array with dimensions `(4, 4, 1, 6)`. This represents the weights for the convolutional layer:
   ```python
   weight = np.zeros((4, 4, 1, 6), dtype=np.float32)
   ```

4. **Setting Weights**: The following lines set specific values in the `weight` matrix to configure it according to certain rules:
   - A row of ones is placed at index `[0, :, :, 0]`.
   - A column of ones is placed at index `[:, 0, :, 1]`.
   - A one is placed on the last row at index `[-1, :, :, 2]`.
   - A column of ones from bottom to top is placed at index `[:, -1, :, 3]`.
   - Diagonal elements are set with values of 1: `[i, i, :, 4]` and off-diagonal elements `[i, 3 - i, :, 5]`.

5. **Shape Verification**: The shape of the `weight` matrix is checked to ensure it matches that of the convolutional layer:
   ```python
   assert weight.shape == conv.weight.shape
   ```

6. **Assigning Weights and Storing Convolutional Layer**: Finally, the initialized weights are assigned to the convolutional layer (`conv`) using `replace`, and this modified convolutional layer is stored as an instance attribute of the class:
   ```python
   self.conv = conv.replace(weight=weight)
   ```

**Note**: Ensure that the necessary imports for `pax.Conv2D` and `np.zeros` are included at the top of the file. Also, verify that the `assert` statement does not raise an error by ensuring the shapes match. This setup is crucial for defining a specific convolutional structure tailored to detecting winning conditions in Connect Four games.
***
### FunctionDef __call__(self, board)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to evaluate whether a given board state in Connect Four results in a winning condition.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: board - A 4D tensor representing the game board, where the first and last dimensions are added as None for compatibility with convolutional layers. The middle two dimensions represent the board's width and height respectively, and each element is expected to be converted into a float32 value.

**Code Description**: 
The function takes in a game board state represented as a 4D tensor `board` and performs several operations to determine if there is a winning condition for Connect Four. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Board Conversion**: The input `board` is first reshaped and converted into a float32 type using the line:
   ```python
   board = board[None, :, :, None].astype(jnp.float32)
   ```
   This step ensures that the board is in the correct format for subsequent operations. Specifically, it adds an extra dimension at both the start and end of the tensor to match the expected input shape for convolutional layers.

2. **Convolution Operation**: The reshaped `board` is then passed through a convolutional layer represented by `self.conv(board)`. This operation likely involves sliding filters over the board to detect patterns that indicate potential winning moves or outcomes.

3. **Magnitude Calculation**: The maximum absolute value of the resulting tensor from the convolution operation is calculated using:
   ```python
   m = jnp.max(jnp.abs(x))
   ```
   Here, `x` represents the output of the convolutional layer. This step helps identify the most significant change or pattern detected by the filters.

4. **Direction Determination**: The direction of the winning move (if any) is determined using:
   ```python
   m1 = jnp.where(m == jnp.max(x), 1, -1)
   ```
   If `m` equals the maximum value in `x`, it means a strong positive or negative pattern was detected. In such cases, `m1` will be set to 1 (indicating a winning move) or -1 (indicating an opposing player's winning move). Otherwise, it is set to 0.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns:
   ```python
   return jnp.where(m == 4, m1, 0)
   ```
   This line checks if `m` equals 4, which would indicate a specific winning condition (e.g., four consecutive pieces in a row). If so, it returns `m1`, otherwise, it returns 0.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the board state is correctly formatted before passing it to this function.
- The convolutional layer (`self.conv`) must be properly initialized and configured for accurate detection of winning conditions.
- The specific value 4 used in the condition might need adjustment based on the game rules being implemented (e.g., if a different number of consecutive pieces constitutes a win).

**Output Example**: 
If the function is called with a board state that has four consecutive pieces, it will return either `1` or `-1`, depending on whether those pieces belong to the player's winning move. Otherwise, it returns `0`. For example:
```python
output = __call__(board_state)
print(output)  # Possible outputs: 1, -1, or 0
```

This output can be used in further game logic to determine if a player has won or not.

***
### FunctionDef num_actions(self)
**num_actions**: The function of num_actions is to return the number of columns in the Connect4Game board.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
This method `num_actions` returns the number of columns present on the game board, which is a key attribute for determining the possible actions or moves that can be made in the game. The value returned by this function corresponds to the `self.num_cols` instance variable, indicating the width of the Connect4Game grid.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `num_cols` is properly initialized and updated whenever there are changes to the board dimensions.
- This method is useful for validating moves or calculating possible actions in AI implementations or game state checks.

**Output Example**: If the Connect4Game instance was created with a 7-column board (a common configuration), then `num_actions()` would return `7`.
***
### FunctionDef invalid_actions(self)
**invalid_actions**: The function of invalid_actions is to identify columns where placing a piece would result in an immediate loss or violation of game rules.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
· parameter1: None (The method does not accept any external input arguments)
**Code Description**: 
- The `invalid_actions` method returns a chex.Array indicating whether the current column selections are invalid. A value of 1 in the array indicates that placing a piece in the corresponding column would be an invalid action, while a value of 0 indicates it is valid.
- Specifically, the function checks if any selected column has already reached the maximum number of pieces allowed (i.e., `self.num_rows`), which means that attempting to place another piece there would result in an immediate loss or rule violation. The method then returns an array with a value of 1 for such columns and 0 otherwise.
- This function is likely used during gameplay to determine if certain moves by a player are permissible, ensuring the game progresses according to predefined rules.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `self.col_counts` accurately reflects the number of pieces in each column at any given time. Any discrepancies could lead to incorrect determination of invalid actions.
- The method assumes that `self.num_rows` is correctly set and represents the maximum allowed height for a column before it becomes invalid.

**Output Example**: 
If the game state has placed 3 pieces in one column out of a possible 6, then calling `invalid_actions()` might return an array like `[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]`, indicating that placing a piece in the third column would be invalid.
***
### FunctionDef reset(self)
**reset**: The function of reset is to initialize or restart the game state.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters as it operates on instance variables directly.

**Code Description**: 
The `reset` method within the `Connect4Game` class is responsible for resetting the game state back to its initial conditions. When called, this method performs several actions:
- **board**: It sets the game board to a zero matrix using JAX's `jnp.zeros`, indicating an empty game state.
- **who_play**: It assigns the current player (player 1) by setting the variable `self.who_play` to `1`.
- **col_counts**: It initializes the column count array to zeros, which keeps track of how many pieces have been placed in each column.
- **terminated**: It sets the game termination status to `False` by assigning `0` to `self.terminated`, indicating that the game has not ended yet.
- **winner**: It sets the winner variable to `0`, signifying no player has won the game.

This method is crucial for ensuring that after a game ends, the next game can start with all necessary variables reset to their initial states. The `reset` function is called both during initialization and potentially at any point where it's needed to restart the game from scratch.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the game state is properly reset before starting a new game to avoid carrying over data from previous sessions.
- This method should be called whenever you want to start a fresh game, such as after a player wins or when restarting for testing purposes.
***
### FunctionDef step(self, action)
**step**: The function of step is to execute one move in the Connect4Game.
**parameters**: 
· action: chex.Array - This parameter represents the column index where the player intends to drop their token.

**Code Description**: 
The `step` method simulates a single turn in the Connect4 game. It takes an `action`, which is the column index where the current player intends to place their token. The function then performs several operations:

1. **Determine Row Index and Check Invalid Move**: It calculates the row index for the chosen column by checking the number of tokens already present in that column (`self.col_counts[action]`). If this value exceeds `self.num_rows`, it indicates an invalid move, setting `invalid_move` to True.

2. **Update Board State**: If the move is valid (i.e., not full), a new token is placed at the calculated row and column position on the board with the current player's identifier (`self.who_play`). This updated state of the board is then assigned back to `self.board`.

3. **Check for Winner or Termination Conditions**: The method updates the game’s internal state by checking if there has been a winner using the `winner_checker` function, and adjusts the `self.winner` attribute accordingly. It also toggles the current player (`self.who_play = -self.who_play`) to switch turns.

4. **Increment Column Counter**: The column counter for the chosen action is incremented by 1 to keep track of how many tokens have been placed in each column so far (`self.col_counts.at[action].set(self.col_counts[action] + 1)`).

5. **Evaluate Game Termination Conditions**: Several conditions are checked to determine if the game should be terminated:
   - If there has been a winner, set `self.terminated` to True.
   - Check if all slots on the board have been filled (`count >= self.num_cols * self.num_rows`), indicating a draw or full board scenario.
   - If an invalid move was made, also set `self.terminated` to True.

6. **Adjust Reward Based on Move Validity**: The reward is updated based on whether the move was valid or not. An invalid move results in a reward of -1.0, while a valid move's reward is determined by the current state and player (`reward = self.winner * self.who_play`).

7. **Return Updated Game State and Reward**: Finally, the method returns a tuple containing the updated `Connect4Game` instance and the calculated reward.

**Note**: This function ensures that each step in the game adheres to the rules of Connect4, including handling invalid moves gracefully by setting appropriate termination conditions and updating the board state correctly. It also updates the internal state necessary for determining the winner or a draw scenario.

**Output Example**: The return value could be an instance of `Connect4Game` with updated attributes such as `self.board`, `self.winner`, and `self.col_counts`, along with a reward value indicating whether the move was valid (-1.0) or part of the ongoing game (e.g., 0). For example:
```
(game_instance, -1.0)
```
***
### FunctionDef render(self)
**render**: The function of render is to display the current state of the Connect4Game on the screen.
**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `render` method provides a visual representation of the game board by printing it to the console. Here’s a detailed analysis:

1. **Column Headers**: The first line prints column indices from 0 to `self.num_cols - 1`. These are used as headers for the board, making it easier for players to identify columns.
   ```python
   for col in range(self.num_cols):
       print(col, end=" ")
   ```
   
2. **Board Rows and Cells**: The method then iterates over each row of the game board from bottom to top (using `reversed(range(self.num_rows)))` and each column within that row.
   ```python
   for row in reversed(range(self.num_rows)):
       for col in range(self.num_cols):
           # Check the value at the current position on the board
           if self.board[row, col].item() == 1:
               print("X", end=" ")  # If value is 1, it represents a player's piece (e.g., "X")
           elif self.board[row, col].item() == -1:
               print("O", end=" ")  # If value is -1, it represents the opponent's piece (e.g., "O")
           else:
               print(".", end=" ")   # If no piece is present, use a dot
       print()  # Print a newline after each row to move to the next line
   ```

3. **Final Newline**: After printing all rows and columns, an additional newline is printed to ensure proper formatting.
   ```python
   print()
   ```

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `self.num_cols` and `self.num_rows` are defined in the `Connect4Game` class before calling this method. These attributes should represent the dimensions of the game board.
- The `self.board` attribute is assumed to be a NumPy array where each cell holds either 1, -1, or 0 (representing "X", "O", and empty respectively).
- This method is useful for debugging or testing purposes as it provides a simple text-based visualization of the game state.
***
### FunctionDef observation(self)
**observation**: The function of observation is to return the current state of the game board as an array.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `observation` method returns the current state of the Connect4Game's board as a chex.Array, which is essentially a NumPy-like array with type checking. The returned array represents the game board in such a way that each cell can be identified and its state (e.g., empty, player 1 token, or player 2 token) can be retrieved.

In detail, this method accesses the `board` attribute of the Connect4Game class instance. The `board` is likely stored as a 2D array where each element represents a cell on the game board. Typically, in Connect Four, the board would have dimensions 6x7 (6 rows and 7 columns). Each cell can be one of three states: empty (often represented by 0), player 1's token (represented by 1), or player 2's token (represented by -1).

The `chex.Array` type ensures that the returned array has specific properties, such as being immutable and having a known shape, which helps in maintaining consistency across the game logic.

**Note**: Ensure that the `board` attribute is properly initialized before calling this method. Also, note that the return value should be used to update the state of the game or display the current board configuration for players.
**Output Example**: A possible output could be a 6x7 array where each element represents a cell on the Connect4Game board:
```

### FunctionDef canonical_observation(self)
**canonical_observation**: The function of canonical_observation is to return the current state of the game board in a standardized format.

**parameters**:
· self: An instance of the Connect4Game class, which provides access to the game's internal state and methods.

**Code Description**: 
The `canonical_observation` method returns the current state of the Connect Four game board as a chex.Array. This array is derived from the game's board state by multiplying it with the player identifier (`self.who_play`). The resulting array represents the canonical observation, which can be used for training machine learning models or other purposes that require a consistent representation of the game state.

- **Detailed Code Analysis**:
  - `return self.board * self.who_play`: This line multiplies the current board state (`self.board`) by the player identifier (`self.who_play`). The result is an array where each cell represents the player who has placed a piece on that position (or zero if no piece is present). This ensures that the observation is consistent and standardized, making it easier to process for algorithms.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `self.board` contains valid board data before calling this method.
- The value of `self.who_play` should be set appropriately based on whose turn it is in the game (e.g., 1 for Player 1, -1 for Player 2).

**Output Example**: 
If `self.board = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0]]` and `self.who_play = 1`, the output of `canonical_observation()` would be:
```
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 0]]
```
This output clearly shows the board state from the perspective of Player 1.

### FunctionDef is_terminated(self)
**is_terminated**: The function of is_terminated is to determine whether the current state of the Connect4Game instance represents a game that has ended.

**parameters**: 
· self: A reference to the current instance of the Connect4Game class.

**Code Description**: 
The `is_terminated` method checks if the game is in a terminal state. It returns `True` if the game has ended due to a win, draw, or resignation, and `False` otherwise. This method relies on an internal attribute `self.terminated`, which is set by other parts of the Connect4Game class logic when certain conditions are met (e.g., a player wins, no more moves can be made, etc.).

The implementation simply returns the value of `self.terminated`, indicating whether the game has reached its conclusion.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `self.terminated` is properly updated by other methods within the Connect4Game class to accurately reflect the current state.
- This method should not modify any state; it only reads and returns a boolean value.

**Output Example**: 
```python
# Possible return values
print(game.is_terminated())  # Output: True (if game has ended)
print(game.is_terminated())  # Output: False (if game is still ongoing)
```

### FunctionDef max_num_steps(self)
**max_num_steps**: The function of max_num_steps is to determine the maximum number of steps that can be taken in a Connect4Game.
**parameters**: This Function takes no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `max_num_steps` method calculates and returns the total number of possible moves in a game of Connect4. It does this by multiplying the number of columns (`self.num_cols`) with the number of rows (`self.num_rows`). In a standard Connect4 game, there are 7 columns and 6 rows, but this function allows for customization through `num_cols` and `num_rows`. The result is an integer representing the maximum number of steps or moves that can be made in the game before it reaches its end state.
**Note**: 
- Ensure that both `self.num_cols` and `self.num_rows` are positive integers, as they represent physical dimensions. Negative values or zero could lead to incorrect calculations.
- The method assumes a standard Connect4 game where each player alternates turns placing their piece in one of the columns until either a player achieves four consecutive pieces horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or all spaces are filled (resulting in a draw).
**Output Example**: If `self.num_cols` is 7 and `self.num_rows` is 6, then `max_num_steps()` will return 42.

### FunctionDef symmetries(self, state, action_weights)
**symmetries**: The function of symmetries is to generate symmetric states and action weights pairs from a given state and action weights.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: state - A 2D numpy array representing the current game board state.
· parameter2: action_weights - A 1D numpy array representing the weights associated with each possible action.

**Code Description**: The function `symmetries` is designed to create symmetric states and corresponding action weights for a Connect Four game. It takes the current game board state (`state`) and action weights (`action_weights`) as input parameters. 

The function first initializes an output list `out` containing the original state and its associated action weights. Next, it appends another tuple to `out`, which includes the horizontally flipped version of both the state and the action weights. This is achieved by using numpy's `np.flip()` method with `axis=1` to flip the board along the horizontal axis.

The function returns a list containing two elements: 
1. The original state and its associated action weights.
2. A horizontally flipped version of the state and its corresponding action weights.

This approach ensures that both the original and symmetric states are considered, which can be useful in scenarios where the game's rules or evaluation functions need to account for symmetrical positions on the board.

**Note**: Ensure that `state` is a 2D numpy array with dimensions appropriate for the Connect Four game (e.g., 6x7). Also, `action_weights` should be a 1D numpy array of length equal to the number of possible actions in the game.

**Output Example**: Given an input state and action weights as follows:
```python
state = np.array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                  [0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0],
                  [3, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]])
action_weights = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7])
```
The function would return:
```python
[(array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
          [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
          [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
          [0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0],
          [0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0],
          [3, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=int8), array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7])),
 (array([[3, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0],
         [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=int8), array([0.7, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1]))]
```
