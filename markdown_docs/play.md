## ClassDef PlayResults
**PlayResults**: The function of PlayResults is to encapsulate the results of multiple games played between two agents.
**Attributes**:
路 win_count: An array representing the number of wins by one agent over another.
路 draw_count: An array representing the number of draws in the games.
路 loss_count: An array representing the number of losses by one agent against another.

**Code Description**: The `PlayResults` class is a NamedTuple that stores the outcomes of multiple games between two agents. It is primarily used to collect and present the results of evaluations conducted through the `agent_vs_agent_multiple_games` function, which simulates several games between two agents and returns an instance of `PlayResults`.

In the context of the project, `agent_vs_agent_multiple_games` is a high-performance evaluation function that runs multiple games in parallel using hardware acceleration techniques such as device replication. It takes into account various parameters like the number of simulations per move (`num_simulations_per_move`) to ensure each game is sufficiently analyzed.

The results collected from these games are then stored within an instance of `PlayResults`. This class allows for easy access and manipulation of the win, draw, and loss counts, providing a clear overview of how one agent performed against another over multiple iterations. The use of `PlayResults` ensures that the evaluation process is both efficient and straightforward to understand.

The `PlayResults` object is frequently used in the training loop of the main training function (`_`). Specifically, after each epoch of training, two evaluations are conducted: one where the current agent plays against the previous version (old_agent) and another where the old agent plays against the current agent. The results from these evaluations are then printed to provide insights into how well the new agent is performing relative to its predecessor.

**Note**: Ensure that when using `PlayResults`, you handle array operations carefully, especially if the games involve complex state spaces or large numbers of simulations per move. Additionally, be mindful of the memory and computational resources required for handling multiple game results simultaneously.

### FunctionDef cond_fn(state)
**cond_fn**: The function of cond_fn is to determine whether the given state meets certain conditions to continue the game.
**Parameters**:
路 parameter1: state (tuple): A tuple containing the environment and step information.

**Code Description**:
The function `cond_fn` evaluates a specific condition for continuing the game based on the current state. The state is expected to be a tuple where the first element, `env`, represents the environment object, and the last element, `step`, indicates the current step number in the game.
1. **Environment Check**: `not_ended = env.is_terminated() == False`: This line checks if the game has not ended by evaluating whether the `is_terminated()` method of the environment returns a value that is logically false (i.e., the game is still ongoing).
2. **Step Limit Check**: `not_too_long = step <= env.max_num_steps()`: This condition ensures that the number of steps taken does not exceed the maximum allowed number of steps defined by `env.max_num_steps()`.

The function then uses these two boolean conditions to determine if both criteria are met using a logical AND operation: 
`return jnp.logical_and(not_ended, not_too_long)`

If both conditions are true (i.e., the game is still ongoing and the step count has not exceeded the maximum allowed steps), the function returns `True`, indicating that the game should continue. Otherwise, it returns `False`, signaling that the game should terminate.

**Note**: Ensure that the environment object (`env`) has methods such as `is_terminated()` and `max_num_steps()`. The step count provided in the state must be a valid integer.

**Output Example**: If the current step is 99 out of a maximum of 100 steps, and the game has not ended yet, `cond_fn` would return `True`. However, if the step count reaches or exceeds the maximum allowed steps or the game ends prematurely, it would return `False`.
