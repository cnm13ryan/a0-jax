## FunctionDef test_example
**test_example**: The function of test_example is to verify that 1 equals 1.
**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.
**Code Description**: 
The `test_example` function performs an assertion check to confirm that the integer value 1 is equal to itself. It uses Python's built-in `assert` statement, which raises an AssertionError if the condition (in this case, `1 == 1`) evaluates to False. Since the condition is always true, the function does not raise any exceptions and completes successfully.

**Note**: This test is trivial but serves as a basic example of how assertions can be used in testing to ensure simple logical conditions hold true. Ensure that similar straightforward checks are appropriately placed throughout your codebase for robustness and maintainability.
