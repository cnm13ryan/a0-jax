## ClassDef TrainingExample
**TrainingExample**: The function of TrainingExample is to encapsulate the necessary information required for training an AlphaZero model.

**attributes**:
· state: Represents the current state of the game.
· action_weights: Contains the target action probabilities derived from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) policy.
· value: Indicates the target value obtained from self-play results.

**Code Description**: The `TrainingExample` class is a fundamental component in the training pipeline for an AlphaZero model. It serves as a data structure to store and pass information relevant to both policy learning and value prediction during training. Specifically, it holds three key pieces of information:

- **state**: This attribute stores the current state of the game, which could be represented by various features depending on the game being played (e.g., board positions in chess or Go). The state is crucial for understanding the context under which actions and values are evaluated.
  
- **action_weights**: This attribute holds the target action probabilities obtained from MCTS. During self-play, an MCTS algorithm generates a policy that explores different moves and their outcomes. The `action_weights` represent the probability distribution over all possible actions at a given state, indicating how likely each move is to be chosen by an optimal player.
  
- **value**: This attribute indicates the target value of the game from the perspective of the current state. In self-play, this value can be derived based on whether the current state leads to a win or loss for the player whose turn it is. The value helps in training the model to predict outcomes accurately.

The `TrainingExample` class is utilized by several functions within the project. For instance, the `prepare_training_data` function (located in `train_agent.py`) processes self-play data and generates instances of `TrainingExample`. This preprocessing step ensures that each example includes relevant state information, action probabilities, and target values, which are then used for training.

In the context of training, the loss functions (`loss_fn`) and optimization steps (`train_step`) rely on these examples to compute gradients and update model parameters. The `loss_fn` function calculates both value and policy losses by comparing the predicted outputs with the ground truth values and action probabilities stored in each `TrainingExample`. This comparison helps in refining the model's ability to predict both the optimal actions and game outcomes.

**Note**: When using `TrainingExample`, ensure that all attributes are correctly initialized. The state, action_weights, and value should be appropriately formatted arrays or tensors for compatibility with the training framework used (e.g., JAX). Additionally, when creating instances of `TrainingExample` in `prepare_training_data`, make sure to handle edge cases such as terminal states and augmented symmetries properly to maintain data integrity.
## ClassDef MoveOutput
**MoveOutput**: The function of MoveOutput is to encapsulate the output data from a single self-play move.
**Attributes**: 
· state: The current state of the game after executing an action.
· reward: The reward received after executing the action, as determined by the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) policy.
· terminated: A boolean indicating whether the current state is a terminal state (a bad state in the context of the game).
· action_weights: The probabilities assigned to each possible action according to the MCTS policy.

**Code Description**: 
The `MoveOutput` class serves as a container for data generated from executing a single move during self-play, which is an essential process in reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithms. This class is used to capture various pieces of information that are crucial for training the agent, such as the game state before and after the action, the reward received, whether the current state is terminal, and the action probabilities inferred by the MCTS policy.

The `MoveOutput` object is primarily created within the context of the `single_move` function, which is designed to be compatible with JAX's `scan` operation. This function takes in the previous environment state (`env`), a random number generator key (`rng_key`), and a step counter (`step`). It then generates a new action using MCTS, updates the environment based on this action, and returns both an updated environment and a `MoveOutput` object containing the relevant data.

The `MoveOutput` class is closely tied to the process of collecting self-play data for training. The `single_move` function uses `MoveOutput` to store information about each move made during self-play, such as the state before and after the action, the reward obtained, whether the game has ended, and the probabilities assigned to each possible action by the MCTS policy.

This data is then used in subsequent functions like `prepare_training_data`, which processes this collected data to prepare it for training. Specifically, `prepare_training_data` filters out any states that occur after the environment has terminated and computes the value at each state based on the reward information stored within the `MoveOutput` objects. This processed data is then used in the training process to improve the agent's policy.

**Note**: Ensure that the MCTS policy outputs valid action probabilities, as these are critical for generating meaningful `MoveOutput` instances. Additionally, verify that the environment correctly handles state transitions and reward calculations to ensure accurate data collection during self-play.

## FunctionDef loss_fn(net, data)
**loss_fn**: The function of loss_fn is to compute the total loss by summing up value loss and policy loss based on the given network and training example.
· parameter1: net (The current neural network model that will be updated during training)
· parameter2: data (A TrainingExample object containing state, action_weights, and value)

**Code Description**: The `loss_fn` function is a critical component in the training pipeline of an AlphaZero-like reinforcement learning model. It calculates both the value loss and policy loss to guide the optimization process.

1. **Batched Policy Evaluation**: 
   - The function begins by calling `batched_policy(net, data.state)`, which evaluates the network's predictions for the given state stored in `data`. This step generates a new network state (`net`) along with losses related to value and policy.
   
2. **Value Loss Calculation**:
   - The value loss is calculated by comparing the predicted value from the network (obtained during the batched policy evaluation) against the ground truth value provided in `data.value`. This comparison helps in refining the model's ability to predict game outcomes accurately.

3. **Policy Loss Calculation**:
   - The policy loss is computed by comparing the predicted action probabilities output by the network with the target action probabilities stored in `data.action_weights`. This step ensures that the model learns to make optimal moves based on the MCTS-generated policies from self-play games.

4. **Total Loss Aggregation**:
   - Both value and policy losses are aggregated to form a single total loss, which is used to update the network parameters during training.

**Note**: Ensure that `data` contains correctly initialized attributes (state, action_weights, value) for accurate loss computation. The function assumes that the network and optimization steps are compatible with JAX or similar frameworks.

**Output Example**: 
The return value of `loss_fn` includes a tuple where the first element is the total loss, and the second element is another tuple containing the updated network state (`net`) and detailed losses (value_loss, policy_loss). For example:
```
(total_loss, (net, (value_loss, policy_loss)))
```

# Object Documentation: `UserAuthenticationService`

## Overview

The `UserAuthenticationService` is a critical component of the application's security infrastructure, responsible for managing user authentication processes. It ensures that only authorized users can access protected resources by verifying their credentials against a secure and reliable database.

## Key Features

- **User Login**: Facilitates the login process for registered users.
- **Password Reset**: Provides functionality to reset forgotten passwords securely.
- **Session Management**: Manages user sessions, ensuring they remain active until explicitly logged out or session expiry.
- **Token Generation**: Generates secure tokens for various authentication purposes.

## Usage

### Initialization

To initialize the `UserAuthenticationService`, you need to configure it with necessary dependencies such as a database connection and security settings. Here's an example of how to set up the service:

```python
from user_authentication_service import UserAuthenticationService

# Example configuration
config = {
    "database_connection": db_connection,
    "security_settings": {"salt_rounds": 12}
}

auth_service = UserAuthenticationService(config)
```

### User Login

To authenticate a user, call the `login` method with the provided credentials:

```python
user_credentials = {"username": "john_doe", "password": "secure_password"}

result = auth_service.login(user_credentials)

if result.success:
    print("Login successful")
else:
    print(f"Login failed: {result.error_message}")
```

### Password Reset

To initiate a password reset, use the `request_reset` method:

```python
email_address = "john_doe@example.com"

auth_service.request_reset(email_address)
```

The service will send an email with instructions to reset the user's password.

## Security Considerations

- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using a secure algorithm before storage and verification.
- **Secure Token Generation**: Tokens used for authentication and session management are generated with strong cryptographic methods.
- **Session Expiry**: Sessions expire after a set period of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access.

## Error Handling

The `UserAuthenticationService` returns detailed error messages when operations fail. These errors can be handled by catching exceptions or checking the result object's `success` attribute:

```python
try:
    auth_service.login(user_credentials)
except AuthenticationError as e:
    print(f"Failed to authenticate: {e}")
```

## Dependencies

- **Database Connection**: Required for storing and retrieving user credentials.
- **Security Settings**: Configurations related to hashing algorithms, token generation, etc.

## Support and Maintenance

For any issues or enhancements, please refer to the official documentation or contact the support team at support@company.com. Regular updates and maintenance are provided to ensure the service remains robust and secure.

### FunctionDef lr_schedule(step)
**lr_schedule**: The function of lr_schedule is to calculate the learning rate based on the current training step.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: step (int or jnp.array): The current training step number.
· parameter2: learning_rate (float or jnp.array): The initial learning rate value.
· parameter3: lr_decay_steps (int or jnp.array): The number of steps after which the learning rate decays.

**Code Description**: This function calculates the learning rate at a given training step using an exponential decay schedule. Here is a detailed analysis:

1. **Initialization and Calculation**:
   - `e = jnp.floor(step * 1.0 / lr_decay_steps)`: The variable `e` represents the number of times the learning rate has decayed so far. This calculation ensures that `e` is an integer by using `jnp.floor`, which rounds down to the nearest whole number.

2. **Decay Calculation**:
   - `return learning_rate * jnp.exp2(-e)`: The function returns the current learning rate after applying exponential decay. Here, `jnp.exp2(-e)` computes \(2^{-e}\), representing an exponential decay factor. Multiplying this by the initial learning rate (`learning_rate`) gives a dynamically adjusted learning rate over time.

**Note**: Ensure that all input parameters are compatible types (int or jnp.array) to avoid runtime errors. Also, pay attention to the value of `lr_decay_steps`; if it is too small compared to `step`, the learning rate may decay very rapidly, potentially leading to unstable training.

**Output Example**: If `learning_rate` is 0.1, `lr_decay_steps` is 5000, and `step` is 2500, then:
- `e = jnp.floor(2500 / 5000) = 0`
- The function returns `0.1 * jnp.exp2(-0) = 0.1`

Thus, the output learning rate at step 2500 is still 0.1. If `step` increases to 7500:
- `e = jnp.floor(7500 / 5000) = 1`
- The function returns `0.1 * jnp.exp2(-1) = 0.05`

Thus, the output learning rate at step 7500 is 0.05.

### FunctionDef _stack_and_reshape
**_stack_and_reshape**: The function of _stack_and_reshape is to stack multiple input arrays along a new axis and then reshape the resulting array.

**Parameters**:
· xs: A variable number of 1D or higher-dimensional NumPy arrays that need to be stacked and reshaped.

**Code Description**:
The `_stack_and_reshape` function takes a variable number of input arrays (`*xs`) and performs two main operations on them:

1. **Stacking**: It uses `np.stack(xs)` to stack the input arrays along a new axis. The resulting array has one additional dimension compared to the original inputs, where this new axis corresponds to the different input arrays.

2. **Reshaping**: After stacking, it reshapes the stacked array using `np.reshape(x, (num_devices, -1) + x.shape[1:])`. Here, `x` refers to the stacked array. The new shape is defined as `(num_devices, -1) + x.shape[1:]`, where:
   - `num_devices`: This parameter specifies the number of devices or splits along the first axis.
   - `-1` in the reshaped array indicates that NumPy should calculate the size of this dimension based on the total size and other dimensions.

The function returns the reshaped array, which is now organized into chunks suitable for parallel processing across multiple devices.

**Note**: Ensure that all input arrays have compatible shapes except along the axis being stacked. The `num_devices` parameter must be a positive integer indicating how many chunks to split the stacked array into.

**Output Example**: If you pass three 1D arrays of shape (5,) and set `num_devices = 2`, the output might look like this:
```
array([[[ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.],
        [ 5.,  6.,  7.,  8.,  9.]],

       [[ 0.,  1.,  2.,  3.,  4.],
        [10., 11., 12., 13., 14.]]])
```
The output array has a shape of `(2, 2, 5)`, split into two chunks for each device.
