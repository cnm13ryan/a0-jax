## FunctionDef batched_policy(agent, states)
**batched_policy**: The function of batched_policy is to apply a policy to a batch of states and return the updated agent.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: agent (The current policy or neural network model that will be applied to the states)
· parameter2: states (A batch of input states on which the policy will be applied)

**Code Description**: The function `batched_policy` takes an agent and a batch of states as inputs. It applies the given agent's policy to these states, returning both the original agent and the updated state-action evaluations. This process is crucial for updating the policy based on new state information in reinforcement learning algorithms.

The function works as follows:
1. The `agent(states, batched=True)` call evaluates the agent's policy over a batch of states.
2. The result of this evaluation is not returned directly; instead, both the original `agent` and the updated evaluations are returned together.

This method ensures that the state evaluations can be used for further processing or learning within the training loop. For instance, it plays a key role in computing value losses and policy losses in the loss function defined in `train_agent.py`.

In another context, as seen in `tree_search.py/improve_policy_with_mcts`, this function is used to initialize the MCTS process by providing prior probabilities (represented by `prior_logits`) and initial values for each state.

**Note**: Ensure that the states passed to `batched_policy` are compatible with the agent's expected input format. The `batched=True` parameter indicates that the policy should handle a batch of states, not individual ones.

**Output Example**: 
The function might return something like:
```
(agent_updated, (action_logits, value))
```
Where `agent_updated` is the same object as `agent`, but potentially with internal state updated based on the evaluation. The tuple `(action_logits, value)` contains the evaluations of actions and their corresponding values for each state in the batch.

# Object Documentation: `DatabaseConnectionManager`

## Overview

The `DatabaseConnectionManager` is a critical component responsible for establishing, maintaining, and managing database connections within the application. It ensures that the application can efficiently communicate with the database to perform various operations such as data retrieval, insertion, update, and deletion.

## Responsibilities

- **Establishing Connections**: Creates and manages database connection instances.
- **Connection Pool Management**: Implements a connection pool to optimize resource usage by reusing existing connections instead of creating new ones for each request.
- **Error Handling**: Handles exceptions related to database connectivity issues and provides appropriate error messages or fallback mechanisms.
- **Configuration Management**: Reads configuration settings from the application's environment variables or configuration files.

## Usage

### Initialization

The `DatabaseConnectionManager` is initialized with necessary parameters such as database URL, username, password, and connection pool size. These parameters can be configured via environment variables or a configuration file.

```python
from config import DB_CONFIG

connection_manager = DatabaseConnectionManager(
    url=DB_CONFIG['DATABASE_URL'],
    user=DB_CONFIG['DATABASE_USER'],
    password=DB_CONFIG['DATABASE_PASSWORD'],
    max_connections=10
)
```

### Managing Connections

The `DatabaseConnectionManager` provides methods to acquire and release database connections. These methods ensure that the connection is properly managed within a context, making it thread-safe.

```python
with connection_manager.get_connection() as conn:
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
    results = cursor.fetchall()
```

### Error Handling

In case of any issues with database connectivity or query execution, the `DatabaseConnectionManager` will handle these errors gracefully. It ensures that the application does not crash and provides meaningful error messages.

```python
try:
    conn = connection_manager.get_connection()
    # Perform operations on the connection
except DatabaseError as e:
    print(f"Database error: {e}")
```

### Configuration

Configuration settings can be updated dynamically by modifying environment variables or updating the configuration file. The `DatabaseConnectionManager` will automatically pick up these changes without requiring a restart.

```python
# Update environment variable
export DATABASE_URL="new_database_url"

# Reconfigure the connection manager if needed
connection_manager.update_config(DB_CONFIG)
```

## API Reference
