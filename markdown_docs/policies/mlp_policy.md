## ClassDef MlpPolicyValueNet
**MlpPolicyValueNet**: The function of MlpPolicyValueNet is to predict action probabilities and state values using a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture.
**Attributes**:
· input_dims: The dimensions of the input state, defaulting to a 1D array with size 4.
· num_actions: The number of possible actions, set to 4 by default.

**Code Description**: 
The `MlpPolicyValueNet` class is designed for policy and value prediction in reinforcement learning tasks. It consists of two main parts: the backbone network which processes the input state, and two heads that generate action logits and state values respectively.

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:
   - The constructor initializes the MLP with a specified input dimension `input_dims` (default is 4) and number of actions `num_actions` (also default is 4).
   - It sets up a backbone network using `pax.Sequential`, which includes a linear layer followed by ReLU activation, to process the flattened input state.
   - Two heads are defined: 
     - The `action_head` processes the output from the backbone and predicts action logits through two layers with ReLU activations.
     - The `value_head` processes the same output from the backbone but outputs a single value using tanh activation for squashing the output to [-1, 1].

2. **Method (`__call__` method)**:
   - This method is used to predict action probabilities and state values given an input state.
   - It accepts `x`, which represents the board state, either as a batched or unbatched array.
   - The input `x` is reshaped if it's not already in the correct shape for processing by the network.
   - The backbone processes the input to extract features.
   - The action logits are computed using the `action_head`, and the value is derived from the `value_head`.
   - If the input was batched, the output values are reshaped appropriately; otherwise, single-element outputs are returned.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input state `x` has the correct dimensions as specified by `input_dims`.
- The action logits are unnormalized probabilities and can be used with a softmax function for probability distribution.
- Values from the `value_head` are typically scaled between -1 and 1 due to tanh activation.

**Output Example**: 
If an input state is passed, the method returns a tuple `(action_logits, value)`. For example:
```python
# Assuming input state x of shape (batch_size, D)
output = mlp_policy_value_net(x)
print(output)  # Output: (array([0.1, 0.2, -0.3, 0.4]), array([-0.6]))
```
In this example, `action_logits` represents the unnormalized probabilities for each action, and `value` is the predicted state value.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, input_dims, num_actions)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the MlpPolicyValueNet class.
**parameters**:
· parameter1: input_dims (tuple, default=(4,))
   - Specifies the dimensions of the input data. By default, it assumes an input dimension of 4.
· parameter2: num_actions (int, default=4)
   - Defines the number of possible actions that can be taken in the environment or task.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method sets up the structure for a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) policy value network. It initializes several key components:

1. **Initialization using `super().__init__()`**: This line calls the constructor of the parent class, ensuring that any necessary initialization steps defined in the base class are executed.

2. **Backbone Layer (`self.backbone`)**: 
   - A sequential neural network layer is created with a linear transformation followed by ReLU activation. The input size is determined by `np.prod(input_dims)`, which multiplies all elements of `input_dims`. This layer transforms the input data into a 128-dimensional space.

3. **Action Head (`self.action_head`)**: 
   - Another sequential neural network layer is defined, which takes the output from the backbone as input and produces an output with `num_actions` neurons. It consists of two linear transformations followed by ReLU activations in between to introduce non-linearity. Essentially, this part of the network predicts action values based on the input state.

4. **Value Head (`self.value_head`)**:
   - Similar to the action head, but instead of predicting actions, it outputs a single value representing the estimated value function for the given input state. It also consists of two linear layers followed by ReLU activations.

5. **Input Dimensions Storage**:
   - The `input_dims` attribute is assigned with the provided `input_dims`. This information will be useful during inference or when defining network architectures that depend on input dimensions.

The overall structure of this class allows for a policy-value network to be created, which can predict both action values and state values given an input state. This setup is commonly used in reinforcement learning algorithms where both the optimal actions and their associated values need to be estimated simultaneously.

**Note**: Ensure that `pax` and other dependencies are correctly imported before using this class. Also, verify that the dimensions provided for `input_dims` match the expected input shape of your data.

### FunctionDef __call__(self, x, batched)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to process input board states and produce action logits and value predictions.
**parameters**: 
· x: the board state. This can be either a single board state with shape [D] or a batch of board states with shape [batch_size, D].
· batched: A boolean flag indicating whether the input `x` is already in a batch format (default is False).

**Code Description**: The __call__ method processes an input board state and returns action logits and value predictions. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - Convert the input `x` to float32 type using `astype(jnp.float32)`.
   - If `batched` is False, add a batch dimension to `x` by wrapping it in an array with shape [1, D] using `x[None]`.

2. **Flattening Input**:
   - Reshape the input `x` to have the first dimension as the batch size and flatten the remaining dimensions using `jnp.reshape(x, (x.shape[0], -1))`. This step ensures that the input is in a format suitable for processing by the neural network.

3. **Forward Pass Through Backbone**:
   - Pass the reshaped input `x` through the backbone network (`self.backbone(x)`). The backbone network processes the input and extracts relevant features.

4. **Action Logits Calculation**:
   - Compute action logits using the output of the backbone network by passing it through the action head (`action_logits = self.action_head(x)`).

5. **Value Prediction**:
   - Predict the value using a tanh activation function applied to the output of the value head (`value = jax.nn.tanh(self.value_head(x))`). The tanh function ensures that the value prediction is within the range [-1, 1].

6. **Batch Handling**:
   - If `batched` is True, return action logits and value predictions for each batch element as slices of the corresponding arrays (`action_logits[:, :], value[:, 0]`).
   - If `batched` is False, return single-action logits and a single value prediction by indexing into the first elements of the corresponding arrays (`action_logits[0, :], value[0, 0]`).

**Note**: Ensure that the input board state `x` matches the expected dimensions for the backbone network. The method handles both single and batched inputs seamlessly.

**Output Example**: 
- If input is a single board state: 
  ```python
  (action_logits[1, ...], value[1])
  ```
- If input is a batch of board states:
  ```python
  (action_logits[:, ...], value[:, 0])
  ```
