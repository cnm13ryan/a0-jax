## ClassDef ResidualBlock
**ResidualBlock**: The function of ResidualBlock is to implement a residual block consisting of convolutional layers.

**attributes**: 
· dim: The dimensionality of the input and output features, which determines the number of channels in each convolution layer.

**Code Description**: 

The `ResidualBlock` class is designed to create a building block for deep neural networks, particularly those using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). A residual block consists of two main parts: a series of operations applied to an input tensor `x`, followed by the addition of the original input `x` to the transformed output. This design helps in mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and allows for deeper network architectures.

1. **Initialization (`__init__` Method)**:
   - The constructor takes one parameter: `dim`, which specifies the number of channels or features in the convolutional layers.
   - It initializes two batch normalization layers (`self.batchnorm1` and `self.batchnorm2`) to normalize the inputs before applying activation functions.
   - Two convolutional layers (`self.conv1` and `self.conv2`) are created, each with `dim` output channels and a kernel size of 3.

2. **Forward Pass (`__call__` Method)**:
   - The method takes an input tensor `x` and applies the residual block operations.
   - A temporary variable `t` is used to store intermediate results.
   - First, `x` is passed through batch normalization followed by a ReLU activation function.
   - Then, it goes through the first convolutional layer.
   - Next, another batch normalization and ReLU are applied.
   - Finally, it passes through the second convolutional layer.
   - The output of the last convolutional layer is added to the original input `x`, resulting in the final output.

**Note**: When using this class, ensure that the dimensionality specified (`dim`) matches the expected number of channels in your input data. Additionally, the batch normalization and ReLU operations are crucial for maintaining stability during training.

**Output Example**: Given an input tensor `x` with shape `[batch_size, height, width, dim]`, the output will have the same shape as `x`. For instance, if `dim = 64`, the input and output tensors will both have a fourth dimension of size 64.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, dim)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ResidualBlock with the given dimension.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: dim (int) - The number of input and output channels for the convolutional layers.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method in the `ResidualBlock` class initializes the block by performing several key operations:

- **super().__init__()**: This line calls the constructor of the superclass, which is likely part of a base class or another abstract base class that provides common initialization steps for all blocks.

- **self.batchnorm1 = pax.BatchNorm2D(dim, True, True)**: Here, a batch normalization layer (`BatchNorm2D`) is created with `dim` channels. The parameters `True, True` are likely used to indicate whether the layer should perform affine transformations and use global statistics during training.

- **self.batchnorm2 = pax.BatchNorm2D(dim, True, True)**: Similar to above, another batch normalization layer is instantiated for the second part of the residual block.

- **self.conv1 = pax.Conv2D(dim, dim, 3)**: A convolutional layer (`Conv2D`) with a kernel size of 3x3 and `dim` input and output channels is created. This layer processes the input tensor to produce an output tensor of the same dimensionality.

- **self.conv2 = pax.Conv2D(dim, dim, 3)**: Another convolutional layer identical in configuration to `conv1` is instantiated. This helps preserve the dimensions for the residual connection within the block.

**Note**: Ensure that the input and output dimensions are consistent across all layers. The use of batch normalization can help stabilize training by normalizing the inputs at each mini-batch, which is crucial for deep networks like ResNet. Adjusting the parameters `True, True` in `BatchNorm2D` might be necessary depending on specific requirements or experimental settings.
***
### FunctionDef __call__(self, x)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to process an input tensor `x` through a series of operations and return the result.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: x (jnp.ndarray): Input tensor to be processed.

**Code Description**: This method implements the forward pass of a Residual Block, which is a key component in the ResNet architecture. The process involves several steps:
- **Step 1:** Assign the input `x` to a temporary variable `t`.
- **Step 2:** Apply batch normalization and ReLU activation to `t`, followed by a convolution operation using `self.conv1`. This step enhances feature extraction and introduces non-linearity.
- **Step 3:** Normalize and activate `t` again with ReLU, then apply another convolution operation via `self.conv2`.
- **Step 4:** Add the original input tensor `x` to the processed tensor `t`, which is a key aspect of residual connections in ResNet. This allows the network to learn identity mappings, facilitating deeper architectures.

**Note**: Ensure that all layers (`self.batchnorm1`, `self.conv1`, etc.) are properly initialized and configured before calling this method. The input tensor `x` should have dimensions compatible with the convolutional operations defined by `self.conv1` and `self.conv2`.

**Output Example**: If the input tensor `x` is a 32x32 image, after processing through this Residual Block, the output will also be a 32x32 tensor. This tensor might have different feature representations compared to the original input due to the transformations applied within the block.
***
## ClassDef ResnetPolicyValueNet
**ResnetPolicyValueNet**: The function of ResnetPolicyValueNet is to construct a residual convolutional neural network (CNN) policy-value network with two heads: an action head that outputs action logits and a value head that predicts the value of the state.

**attributes**:
- `input_dims`: The dimensions of the input data, typically in the format `(height, width, channels)` for images.
- `num_actions`: The number of possible actions.
- `dim`: The dimensionality of the feature maps after the initial convolutional layer (default is 64).
- `num_resblock`: The number of residual blocks in the backbone network (default is 5).

**Code Description**: This class implements a two-headed neural network architecture for policy and value prediction. It consists of an input processing stage, followed by a series of residual blocks, and finally two separate heads: one for action logits and another for state values.

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:
   - The constructor initializes the ResnetPolicyValueNet with specified parameters.
   - If `input_dims` does not have a channel dimension, it is added by default.
   - A backbone network is created using sequential layers including convolutional and batch normalization operations.
   - Multiple residual blocks are stacked to form the backbone, enhancing the model’s ability to learn complex feature representations.
   - The action head processes the output of the backbone to predict action logits for each possible action.
   - The value head also processes the same backbone output but focuses on predicting a single scalar value representing the state's value.

2. **Forward Pass (`__call__` method)**:
   - The `__call__` method computes both the policy (action logits) and the value of the input state.
   - It handles both batched and unbatched states, ensuring flexibility in input handling.
   - The input is first converted to float32 type and possibly reshaped if necessary.
   - The backbone network processes the input through convolutional layers.
   - The action head produces action logits for each possible action.
   - The value head computes a scalar value representing the state's estimated value.

**Note**: Ensure that the input data dimensions match those expected by the model, especially regarding the presence of channel dimensions. Batch processing should be correctly managed to avoid errors.

**Output Example**: 
- For an unbatched state: `action_logits` is a 1x1 tensor with logits for each action, and `value` is a scalar representing the estimated value of the state.
- For a batched state: `action_logits` is a 2D tensor where each row corresponds to a different input state, and `value` is a 1D tensor containing the values for each state in the batch.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, input_dims, num_actions, dim, num_resblock)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ResnetPolicyValueNet class.

**parameters**:
· input_dims: The dimensions of the input data.
· num_actions: The number of possible actions.
· dim: The dimensionality of the hidden layers, defaulting to 64.
· num_resblock: The number of residual blocks, defaulting to 5.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the ResnetPolicyValueNet class. It sets up several components necessary for processing input data and generating policy and value outputs.

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - If the provided `input_dims` has a length of 3, it assumes the last element is the number of channels (`num_input_channels`). The method then removes this channel dimension from `input_dims`, setting `self.has_channel_dim` to True. Otherwise, if `input_dims` does not have a channel dimension, `num_input_channels` is set to 1 and `self.has_channel_dim` is False.

2. **Backbone Initialization**:
   - The backbone of the network consists of an initial convolutional layer (`pax.Conv2D`) followed by batch normalization (`pax.BatchNorm2D`). This setup helps in normalizing the input data, which can improve training stability and performance.
   - A series of residual blocks are added to the backbone. Each block is initialized through a loop that repeats `num_resblock` times, each time adding a new ResidualBlock instance to the backbone.

3. **Policy Head Initialization**:
   - The policy head (`action_head`) consists of multiple convolutional layers and batch normalization steps. It processes the output from the backbone and produces a policy output with dimensions corresponding to the number of possible actions.
   
4. **Value Head Initialization**:
   - The value head (`value_head`) also processes the output from the backbone but focuses on producing a single scalar value representing the estimated state value.

5. **Inheritance and Superclass Call**:
   - The method starts by calling `super().__init__()`, which is likely part of an inheritance hierarchy, ensuring that any necessary superclass initialization is performed.
   
6. **Relationship with Callees**:
   - This method interacts with several other classes and methods in the project, such as `ResidualBlock` and various layers from the `pax` module (e.g., `Sequential`, `Conv2D`, `BatchNorm2D`). The `ResidualBlock` class is used to build the backbone of the network, while other layers handle specific processing steps for policy and value outputs.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input data dimensions match expectations or provide appropriate error handling.
- The choice of `num_resblock` can significantly impact model complexity and performance; adjust this parameter based on your specific use case.

### FunctionDef __call__(self, x, batched)
**__call__**: The function of __call__ is to compute the action logits and value from input states.
**parameters**: 
· parameter1: x (chex.Array) - Input state or batch of states to be processed by the policy network.
· parameter2: batched (bool, optional) - A flag indicating whether the input state(s) are already batched. Default is False.

**Code Description**: The __call__ method supports both single and batched input states for computing action logits and values using a ResNet-based policy network architecture. Here’s a detailed breakdown of its operation:

1. **Input Type Handling**: 
   - The method first converts the input state `x` to type `jnp.float32` to ensure numerical stability during computations.
   
2. **Batch Dimension Management**:
   - If `batched` is set to False, the method adds a batch dimension to `x` using `x[None]`. This ensures that even single states are processed as if they were part of a batch.

3. **Channel Dimension Handling**:
   - The code checks whether the input state has a channel dimension (`self.has_channel_dim`). If not present, it adds one by applying `x[..., None]`.

4. **Backbone Processing**:
   - After ensuring the correct shape and type, the method passes the preprocessed input through the backbone network defined in `self.backbone`.

5. **Action Logits Calculation**:
   - The action logits are computed using the `action_head` of the policy network on the output from the backbone.

6. **Value Estimation**:
   - Similarly, the value is estimated by passing the backbone's output through the `value_head` of the network.

7. **Output Formulation**:
   - Depending on whether the input was batched or not, the method returns either a single action logit and value pair (unbatched case) or a batched version of these values.
     - For unbatched inputs: The method extracts the first element from the logits and value arrays to return them as scalar values.
     - For batched inputs: It slices the logits and value arrays at the first index along their respective dimensions, returning the corresponding scalar values.

**Note**: Users should ensure that the input state `x` is appropriately shaped (either a single state or a batch of states) based on the `batched` flag. Also, the presence or absence of a channel dimension in the input affects how the method processes and shapes the data internally.

**Output Example**: 
- For an unbatched input:
  ```python
  action_logits, value = resnet_policy(__call__(x))
  ```
  The `action_logits` would be a scalar representing the logit of the chosen action, and `value` would be a scalar representing the estimated state value.

- For a batched input:
  ```python
  action_logits_batch, value_batch = resnet_policy(__call__(x, batched=True))
  ```
  Here, `action_logits_batch` and `value_batch` are arrays of shape (batch_size,) containing the logit values for each action and the corresponding state values.

The initialization method (`__init__`) takes four parameters:
- `input_dims`: Defines the dimensions of the input data.
- `num_actions`: Specifies the number of possible actions that the model can predict.
- `dim`: Sets the dimensionality of the feature maps after the initial convolutional layer (default is 128).
- `num_resblock`: Determines the number of residual blocks in the backbone network (default is 5).

The class inherits from `ResnetPolicyValueNet`, which provides a two-headed architecture for policy and value prediction. The inherited methods and attributes are used to build the model structure, including convolutional layers, batch normalization, and activation functions.

**Relationship with Callees**: This class directly extends `ResnetPolicyValueNet` by setting specific parameters that define its architecture. It leverages the base class's implementation for constructing the policy and value heads, ensuring consistency in the overall network design while customizing the number of channels and residual blocks.

**Note**: When using ResnetPolicyValueNet128, ensure that the input data dimensions (`input_dims`) are compatible with the model architecture. Additionally, the choice of 128 channels and five residual blocks should be validated based on the specific use case and dataset characteristics to achieve optimal performance.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, input_dims, num_actions, dim, num_resblock)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ResnetPolicyValueNet128 class instance.

· parameter3: dim (int, optional) - The dimensionality of the hidden layers. Default is 128.
· parameter4: num_resblock (int, optional) - The number of residual blocks to use in the network. Default is 5.

**Code Description**: 
The `__init__` method initializes an instance of the ResnetPolicyValueNet128 class by calling its superclass's constructor with the provided parameters. This ensures that any necessary initialization steps defined in the base class are performed first, followed by additional setup specific to the ResnetPolicyValueNet128 class.

The `super().__init__(input_dims, num_actions, dim, num_resblock)` line is a call to the parent class's constructor, passing the input dimensions (`input_dims`), number of actions (`num_actions`), hidden layer dimensionality (`dim`), and the number of residual blocks (`num_resblock`). This initialization process sets up the basic structure of the policy network.

By default, the hidden layer dimension is set to 128 and the number of residual blocks to 5. These values can be overridden when creating an instance of the class by providing different arguments for `dim` and `num_resblock`.

**Note**: Ensure that the input dimensions (`input_dims`) match the expected shape of your input data, as this will affect how the network processes the inputs. Additionally, adjusting the number of residual blocks (`num_resblock`) can impact the complexity and performance of the model; a higher value may lead to more complex models but could also increase training time and resource requirements.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method is a constructor for the ResnetPolicyValueNet256 class. It initializes an instance of this class by setting up its internal state based on the provided parameters. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization with Superclass**: The first line `super().__init__(input_dims, num_actions, dim, num_resblock)` calls the constructor of the superclass (likely another policy or neural network class) to initialize common attributes and setup shared components.
2. **Parameter Handling**: The method accepts four parameters: `input_dims`, `num_actions`, `dim`, and `num_resblock`. These are used to configure the instance according to specific requirements, such as input data dimensions, action space size, hidden layer dimensionality, and the number of residual blocks.
3. **Default Values**: If any of the optional parameters (`dim` or `num_resblock`) are not provided during instantiation, they will default to 256 and 6, respectively.
